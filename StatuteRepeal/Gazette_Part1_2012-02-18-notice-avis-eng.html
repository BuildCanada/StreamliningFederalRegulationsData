        <h3 class="subtitle">CONSULTATIONS ON OPTIONS TO ENHANCE TRADE WITH MERCOSUR </h3>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The Government of Canada is seeking the views of Canadians on the exploratory discussions to enhance Canada&#x2019;s trade relationship with the MERCOSUR countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay).</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">This notice is part of the Government of Canada&#x2019;s domestic consultation process with business, citizen-based organizations and individual Canadians, as well as with provincial and territorial governments, to obtain advice and views on priorities, objectives and concerns to help outline the parameters of this initiative.</p>
        <p>Background </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">On June 24, 2011, the Honourable Ed Fast, Minister of International Trade, announced that Canada and MERCOSUR were moving forward with exploratory discussions to enhance their trade relationship. Through the Global Commerce Strategy, the Government has pledged to improve Canada&#x2019;s competitiveness and to support Canadian firms as they pursue opportunities in the global marketplace. </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">MERCOSUR, also known as the Southern Cone Common Market, is a customs union established by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in 1991. This regional bloc represents a significant economic presence in Latin America. In 2010, the four members of MERCOSUR had a combined GDP of $2.6 trillion and a population of about 243.5 million.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">In 2010, bilateral merchandise trade between Canada and MERCOSUR reached over $8.0 billion, representing an increase of 157.0% over the last decade. Canadian merchandise exports totalled close to $3.0 billion in 2010, with nearly 96% accounted for by exports to Brazil and Argentina (86.1% and 9.5%, respectively). Leading exports included fertilizers, mineral fuels and   oils, machinery, pharmaceuticals, and paper and paperboard. Canada&#x2019;s merchandise imports from MERCOSUR totalled almost $5.1 billion in 2010. Close to 99% of Canada&#x2019;s 2010 imports from MERCOSUR members originated in Brazil (68.2%) and Argentina (30.6%). Leading imports included precious stones and metals, inorganic chemicals, mineral fuels and oils, machinery, and sugar.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">In 2009, Brazil made up the largest share of Canadian services exports to MERCOSUR countries, totalling $358 million, with exports to Argentina following at $82 million.</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Available data indicates that at the end of 2010, stocks of Canadian foreign direct investment in Brazil and Argentina totalled $9.7 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. In 2010, foreign direct Investment in Canada amounted to $13.5 billion from Brazil and $53.0 million from Argentina. (Please note that investment data for Paraguay and Uruguay is unavailable.)</p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Sectors of opportunity initially identified for Canadian trade and investment include environmental industries, information and communication technologies, energy (nuclear, renewable, and oil and gas) and agriculture. Emerging market niches exist in forestry and railways, and there is potential for targeted science and technology collaboration in Antarctic wind/fuel cells and organic foods. The mining and oil and gas sectors offer opportunities for suppliers of equipment and services. </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Canada has Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements with Argentina (1993) and Uruguay (1999). In 2011, Canada and Brazil signed a bilateral Air Transport Agreement, a Social Security Agreement, as well as Memoranda of Understanding on Olympic Games Cooperation and on International Development Aid Effectiveness. Canada and Brazil also have a Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement, which was signed in November of 2008.</p>
        <p>Submissions by interested parties </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The Government of Canada is embarking on a public consultation process to allow all interested stakeholders an opportunity  to provide comments and advice regarding how Canada and MERCOSUR could enhance their trading relationship. We welcome advice and views on any priorities, objectives and/or concerns relating to trade and investment with MERCOSUR. Submissions could include the identification of</p>
        <ul>
          <li>specific sectors or commercial activities of interest in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and/or Uruguay that should be taken into account moving forward; and</li>
          <li>opportunities and/or barriers/challenges when conducting business in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and/or Uruguay. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent-1-0">All interested parties are invited to submit their views by Monday, March 19, 2012. Please be advised that any information received as a result of this consultations process will be considered  as public information, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Submissions must include</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the contributor&#x2019;s name and address and, if applicable, his/her organization, institution or business; </li>

        <p><cite>Notice amending Health Canada&#x2019;s Drug Master Files and Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product fees </cite></p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Health Canada is the federal authority responsible for regulating pharmaceuticals both pre- and post-market and, in doing so, protects the health of Canadians who use these products to maintain and improve their health. In the early 1990s, Health Canada was given the authority under the <cite>Financial Administration Act </cite>to charge industry user fees in order to recover some of the costs related to the regulation of human drugs in Canada. </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">Since the mid 1990s, Health Canada has charged user fees  for two voluntary, non-regulatory services provided to industry through the Drugs Program: the Drug Master Files (DMF) and Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product (CPP). DMF contain information that is referenced in the evaluation of a product regarding its manufacturing. The CPP is a voluntary export certificate that indicates when a Canadian company&#x2019;s drug product is in compliance with Canadian regulatory standards. Both services are voluntary and initiated at the request of industry. </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">In 2007, Health Canada consulted on proposed increases to the DMF and CPP through the 2007 <cite>Official Notice of Fee Proposal for Human Drugs and Medical Devices</cite>. As these fees are non-regulatory they were not included in Health Canada&#x2019;s <cite>Fees in Respect of Drugs and Medical Devices Regulations</cite>, which came into force on April 1, 2011. </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The Minister of Health, under the Ministerial Authority to Enter into Contract, hereby amends the fees that are payable for the provision of DMF and CPP services, beginning April 1, 2012. Health Canada has revised the fees to provide for full cost recovery, based on the associated private benefits of these services. These fees will be updated annually, with an automatic 2% increase to align with the Drug Program&#x2019;s regulatory user fees. </p>
        <p class="indent-1-0">The following table outlines the updated fees for DMF and CPP and the corresponding service standards.</p>
