    <p>Pursuant to Chapter&nbsp;6, paragraph&nbsp;14 of the Tla‚Äôamin Final Agreement (the &ldquo;Final Agreement&rdquo;), the Tla‚Äôamin Nation and British Columbia have completed transfers to each other of parcels of land related to Provincial Crown Road (the &ldquo;Wilde Road Parcels&rdquo;). Due to the scale of the maps in the Final Agreement and the size of the Wilde Road Parcels, no amendment to Appendices&nbsp;C or&nbsp;L of the Final Agreement is required, however the Parties have agreed to amend the Final Agreement generally to document the transfers of the Wilde Road Parcels.</p>
    <p>Therefore, in accordance with Chapter&nbsp;25, paragraph&nbsp;9 of the Final Agreement, the Final Agreement has been amended effective as of May&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2022 to reflect that:</p>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(b) the following parcels were removed from Tla‚Äôamin Lands and transferred to British Columbia as Provincial Crown Road parcels on May&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2018:

    <h3>ANNEX</h3>
    <h3>Summary of the screening assessment of caprolactam</h3>
    <p>Pursuant to section&nbsp;74 of the <cite>Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999</cite> (CEPA), the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health have conducted a screening assessment of 2H-azepin-2-one, hexahydro-, hereinafter referred to as caprolactam. The Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CAS RN)<sup id="fn1-3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">footnote </span>1</a></sup> for caprolactam is&nbsp;105-60-2.</p>
    <p>Caprolactam occurs naturally in some plants. Canadian manufacture quantities are not available for caprolactam. The total annual imports of caprolactam into Canada between 2014 and 2018 ranged from 16&nbsp;639&nbsp;255&nbsp;kg (2018) to 21&nbsp;722&nbsp;366&nbsp;kg (2017), according to the Canadian International Merchandise Trade Database.</p>
    <p>Caprolactam is primarily used as an intermediate in the production of Nylon 6 polymers, which have a broad range of uses, including textiles, carpets, industrial yarns, engineering plastics for industrial and medical applications, as well as some products available to consumers, such as cosmetics, diapers, and 3D printing filaments. Some residual caprolactam may be present in manufactured articles made with Nylon 6. Caprolactam is also used as a plasticizer, and as a component in the manufacturing of paints and coatings, glue sticks and other adhesives. Caprolactam may also be used as a component in the manufacture of certain food packaging materials and as a food flavouring agent.</p>
    <p>The ecological risk of caprolactam was characterized using the ecological risk classification of organic substances (ERC), which is a risk-based approach that employs multiple metrics for both hazard and exposure, with weighted consideration of multiple lines of evidence for determining risk classification. Hazard profiles are based principally on metrics regarding mode of toxic action, chemical reactivity, food web&ndash;derived internal toxicity thresholds, bioavailability, and chemical and biological activity. Metrics considered in the exposure profiles include potential emission rate, overall persistence, and long-range transport potential. A risk matrix is used to assign a low, moderate or high level of potential concern for substances on the basis of their hazard and exposure profiles. Based on the outcome of the ERC analysis, caprolactam is considered unlikely to be causing ecological harm.</p>
    <p>Considering all available lines of evidence presented in this screening assessment, there is a low risk of harm to the environment from caprolactam. It is concluded that caprolactam does not meet the criteria under paragraph&nbsp;64(a) or (b) of CEPA as it is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity, or that constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends.</p>
    <p>In terms of potential effects on human health, in laboratory studies conducted via the oral route with caprolactam, offspring effects (reduced body weights), and clinical effects were observed. Local larynx effects (keratinization of the metaplastic epithelium) were observed in inhalation studies. Potential exposure of the general population of Canada to caprolactam can occur through environmental media (e.g. indoor air and drinking water) and food packaging materials. Potential exposure to caprolactam via food flavouring agents is considered to be negligible. From the use of products available to consumers, the predominant sources of exposure are from glue sticks and from Nylon 6 in carpets, lipsticks, diapers, and 3D&nbsp;printing filaments. On the basis of estimates of exposure compared with critical health effect levels identified from laboratory studies, the margins of exposure are considered to be adequate to address uncertainties in the health effects and exposure data used to characterize risk.</p>
    <p>The human health assessment took into consideration those groups of individuals within the Canadian population who, due to greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be more vulnerable to experiencing adverse health effects. Certain subpopulations are routinely considered throughout the screening assessment process, such as infants, children, and people of reproductive age. Infants may be susceptible to reduced body weight from parental exposure to caprolactam. People living near industrial manufacturing facilities may have higher exposures to caprolactam from evaporative emissions in the air. These subpopulations were taken into account in the human health assessment for caprolactam.</p>
    <p>Considering all the information presented in this screening assessment, it is concluded that caprolactam does not meet the criteria under paragraph&nbsp;64(c) of CEPA as it is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.</p>
    <h3>Overall conclusion</h3>
    <p>It is therefore concluded that caprolactam does not meet any of the criteria set out in section&nbsp;64 of CEPA.</p>

    <h3>FOOD AND DRUGS ACT</h3>
    <h4><cite>Notice of intent to consult on Health Canada‚Äôs Order Amending the Fees in Respect of Drugs and Medical Devices Order</cite></h4>
    <p>In February&nbsp;2023, Health Canada will launch a public consultation on an amendment to the <cite>Fees in Respect of Drugs and Medical Devices Order</cite>.</p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this notice is to inform interested stakeholders of the intent of the Minister of Health to make a consequential amendment to the <cite><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2019-124/FullText.html">Fees in Respect of Drugs and Medical Devices Order</a></cite> (Fees Order) in order to change the reference for Performance Standard and Remission exceptions (section&nbsp;6(2)(c)) from &ldquo;COVID-19 drug&rdquo; to &ldquo;public health emergency drugs&rdquo;. This will give Health Canada the flexibility to quickly implement Interim Orders (IOs) to address emerging public health needs such as COVID-19 in the future.</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Health Canada is proposing regulatory amendments to the <cite><a href="https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/c.r.c.,_c._870/index.html">Food and Drug Regulations</a></cite> (FDR) and <cite><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-98-282/">Medical Devices Regulations</a></cite> that would deliver on the Department‚Äôs modernization commitments and leverage long-standing policies and practices. The proposal also considers recent experiences with regulatory agilities introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. An overview as well as draft regulations can be found here: <a href="/rp-pr/p1/2022/2022-12-17/html/reg1-eng.html"><cite>Agile Licensing, Canada Gazette</cite>, Part I</a>, while more information on how these changes would be implemented can be found here: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/consultation-proposed-agile-regulations-guidance-licensing-drugs-medical-devices.html"><cite>Agile Licensing</cite>, Guidance</a>.</p>
    <p>Currently, section C.08.002(2.3) of the FDR allows manufacturers of designated COVID-19 drugs, as defined in section C.08.001.1, to file a new drug submission that is missing certain information required under section&nbsp;C.08.002 if they include a plan indicating how and when the missing information will be provided (rolling submission). All the missing information must be provided and reviewed before the Minister can decide whether to issue a notice of compliance.</p>
    <p>The <cite>Agile Licensing</cite> proposal would expand this provision respecting rolling submissions for designated COVID-19 drugs to any public health emergency drug (PHED) by repealing the definition of designated COVID-19 drug and introducing the definition of a public health emergency drug.</p>
    <p>Currently, the <cite><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2019-124/FullText.html">Fees in Respect of Drugs and Medical Devices Order</a></cite> (Fees Order) provides an exception for fee remittance (ref. paragraph&nbsp;6(2)(c)) in the case of a new drug submission for a designated COVID-19 drug where C.08.002(2.3) applies to that submission. This exception waives the requirement for Health Canada to remit, in part, the examination fee if the Department‚Äôs performance standards are not met.</p>
    <p>Per the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/guideline-service-digital.html">Guideline on Service and Digital</a>, developed by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, a service standard is defined as a public commitment to a measurable level of performance that clients can expect under normal circumstances. Health Canada has established <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/drugs-health-products/performance-fees-drugs-medical-devices.html">performance standards</a> in relation to fees that are payable under the Fees Order.</p>
    <p>To provide regulatory flexibility to manufacturers for these rolling submissions no fixed timeline for provision of the missing information has been set. Experience gained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that performance standards are not always met for these submissions.</p>
    <p><cite>Proposed amendment</cite></p>
    <p>Health Canada is proposing to amend section&nbsp;6(2)(c) of the Fees Order to replace &ldquo;designated COVID-19 drug&rdquo; with &ldquo;public health emergency drug&rdquo;, thereby addressing the gap created by the repeal of the definition designated COVID-19 drug and extending the exception respecting fee remittance described above, to all PHEDs.</p>
    <p>Reference:</p>
    <p><cite>Current provision</cite></p>
    <h3>Remission&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;performance standard</h3>
    <p>6 (1) If the Minister determines that the performance standard has not been met in relation to a fee that is payable under this Order, remission is granted to the person that must pay the fee</p>
    <ul class="lst-spcd mrgn-lft-lg list-unstyled">
        <li>(a) of an amount equal to 25% of the fee; or</li>
        <li>(b) of an amount equal to 25% of the amount that is payable, in the case where remission is granted of part of the fee under any other provision of this Order.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
    <p>(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a fee for the examination of</p>
    <ul class="lst-spcd mrgn-lft-lg list-unstyled">
        <li>(a) an application or submission referred to in this Order in respect of which a joint or parallel review is conducted by the Minister and a foreign regulatory authority;</li>
        <li>(b) an application for a licence that is filed under section&nbsp;32 of the <cite>Medical Devices Regulations</cite> if
            <ul class="lst-spcd mrgn-lft-lg list-unstyled">
                <li>(i) the medical device to which the application relates includes a component that is a drug, and</li>
                <li>(ii) the Minister has made a decision in respect of the application to issue or amend a medical device licence under section&nbsp;36 of those Regulations, or to refuse to issue or amend such a licence under section&nbsp;38 of those Regulations; or</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(c) a new drug submission for a designated COVID-19 drug if subsection C.08.002(2.3) of the <cite>Food and Drug Regulations</cite> applies to that submission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><cite>Proposed amendment to provision</cite></p>
    <ul class="lst-spcd mrgn-lft-lg list-unstyled">
