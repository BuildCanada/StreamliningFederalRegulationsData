    <p>Notice is hereby given that the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health are currently assessing four lines of gene-edited pigs, pursuant to subsection&nbsp;108(1) of the <cite>Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999</cite>,<sup id="fn1-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">footnote </span>1</a></sup> and invite, pursuant to subsection&nbsp;108.1(1) of that Act, any interested persons to submit comments from June 20 to July 20, 2025.</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The <cite>New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms)</cite> help protect people living in Canada and the environment, as they allow for the assessment of new living organisms, including higher organisms such as pigs, prior to their introduction into the Canadian marketplace. Following a New Substances Notification, Environment and Climate Change Canada and Health Canada carry out a joint assessment process to determine whether there is a potential for risk to the environment and human health.</p>
    <p>In June&nbsp;2023, Bill S-5, <cite>Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act</cite>, received royal assent, amending the <cite>Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999</cite> by introducing, among other things, new obligations concerning living organisms new to Canada. For instance, consultation is now mandatory for all assessments conducted under subsection&nbsp;108(1) or (2) in respect of a vertebrate animal or a prescribed living organism or group of living organisms before the end of the assessment period.</p>
    <h3>Consultation</h3>
    <p>The New Substances program is currently evaluating four lines of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus resistant pigs&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;notified by Genus PLC on April&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2025.
