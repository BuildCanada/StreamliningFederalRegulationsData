Yonah Martin (Deputy Leader of the Opposition): </b>Honourable senators, what an honour to pay tribute to a remarkable Canadian and decorated war hero, the late George Chow, who passed away on November¬†6, 2020, one day after his ninety-ninth birthday.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >George joined the Canadian Army on August¬†27, 1940, just shy of his nineteenth birthday, and enlisted to serve in World War II. He did all this without his parents‚Äô knowledge. Even at a young age, he felt the call of duty and, without hesitation, was ready to serve his country. He later admitted that all he wanted was to escape following his father into the hard life of pig farming on Vancouver Island. During basic training at Seaforth Armoury in Vancouver, George exchanged his pitchfork for a broomstick. After his training, he boarded a ship in Halifax to England. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Once in England, he was assigned to a base in Colchester, where he became a member of the all-Canadian gun crew that shot down the first German plane on English soil. During World War II, George landed on Juno Beach following D-Day and saw action in France, Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands. In fact, he was involved in the liberation of The Netherlands on May¬†5, 1944. If the victory in Europe wasn‚Äôt enough, he volunteered to fight in one of the most dangerous parts of the war, in the Pacific. After the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, George was honourably discharged on October¬†12, 1945, and returned to Vancouver, B.C.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >For George and other Asians living in Canada, such as Frank Wong, Second World War service gave them their first taste of equality. Frank recounted being treated ‚Äúlike a second-class citizen in youth.‚Äù In the army ‚Äúthey treated me just like an equal.¬†.¬†.¬†. You have your uniform, you‚Äôre in it together; you eat together and you sleep together.‚Äù</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In 1950, he joined the 43rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Canadian Artillery as a gunnery instructor, attaining the rank of Warrant Officer, 2nd Class, and was then appointed Battery Sergeant Major in 1959. He finished his military service in 1963 as Master Warrant Officer.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >After retiring, George became a member of the Chinese Canadian Military Museum and a member of the Royal Canadian Legion. He was active in both and enjoyed participating in various ceremonies and events to honour his fallen comrades, and he visited many schools to speak directly to students.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >George dedicated his life to serving his country and fighting for freedom and democracy. His courage and heroism earned him respect among his fellow comrades and community. In 2012, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal and, in 2014, the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur, the rank of Knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honour. He later received the highest distinction by the French government and was presented with the Medal of the Legion of Honour in April¬†2015.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >George is a true Canadian hero but, above all, he was a husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather, friend and respected leader. He was a kind-hearted and courageous man who will be greatly missed but never forgotten. His legacy lives on and will be remembered by those he touched during his lifetime. As perfectly expressed by Philippe Sutter, Consul General of France in Vancouver: </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >For everything he did for us, we say Merci. For everything we owe to him, we will never forget Mr.¬†George Chow. Building on his legacy, we will continue to build a better world based on our common values, respect and multilateralism.</p>

 <h2 id="7" >16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence</h2>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Nancy J. Hartling: </b>Honourable senators, today, December¬†10, is International Human Rights Day, and the last day of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. These 16 days are an opportunity for all of us to renew our commitment to end gender-based violence.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In 2019, UN Women reported that 243 million women and girls were abused by their intimate partners. In Canada, a woman is killed by her partner every six days, and on any given night, close to 5,000 women and girls are in transition houses.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In 2020, with increased unemployment, sudden lockdowns and restricted movement due to the pandemic, there has been a rise in gender-based violence. Not only are women experiencing more violence at home, they are having greater difficulty accessing support services and shelters. This is known as the ‚ÄúShadow Pandemic.‚Äù Unfortunately, there will be no vaccine developed to eradicate it.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Over the summer, Senator Boyer, Senator Boniface and I engaged law students from the University of Ottawa. They conducted research relating to the impacts of the pandemic on transition houses and community resources and their ability to serve their clients¬†‚Äî women and their children.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Some of the key findings include that, initially, reporting of abuse went down. However, the incidents being reported were of more severe violence.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Social distancing and public health directives for shelters meant that they had to reduce the capacity of their already limited beds.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Shelters rely heavily on fundraising and corporate donations, and the pandemic significantly impacted their ability to raise funds and stretched their limited finances greatly.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Indigenous women have been disproportionately impacted. Accessing shelters was already difficult for them as some do not have culturally appropriate services, while Indigenous-only shelters are scarce and often a long distance from rural communities. For example, in New Brunswick there is only one Indigenous shelter, which means some women would have to travel up to four hours to access it.</p>
 <p >(1410)</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Finally, the shelter employees, mostly women, are greatly impacted. They are being paid modest wages to do difficult work with limited resources. This has been made worse by the pandemic, where many had to deal with chronic understaffing due to issues such as self-isolation protocols, increased child care duties and uncertainty about possible exposure to the virus. Of course, all of this impacts their mental health.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The research data reaffirmed our failed attempt at ending violence against women and girls and provided us with reasons to seriously consider next steps to address these findings. One strategy might be to open an inquiry in the Senate on this issue. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >We must not abandon women and their children at this time when they need us most. Let‚Äôs recommit to ending gender-based violence. We were all asked to stay at home during this pandemic and to be safe, but not all of us who stayed home were safe. Thank you.</p>

Ms.¬†Kane will join Canada‚Äôs Sports Hall of Fame and receive the Order of Sport award. That‚Äôs Canada‚Äôs highest sporting honour. She will be the fourth Islander to earn a spot in the Hall of Fame and the first in more than 50 years.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In addition to this latest honour, Ms.¬†Kane has four LPGA tour victories, has been named Canadian Female Athlete of the Year twice, and is a member of the PEI Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame.

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Lorie Kane has been active in the charitable sector as the first ambassador of KidSport PEI, an organization that helps remove the financial barriers that limit some children from participating in sport. She also collaborated with McDonald‚Äôs to start the Lorie Kane Charity Golf Classic in support of McDonald‚Äôs children‚Äôs charities. Most recently, she collaborated with Canadian Pacific on its CP Has Heart program. During the week of the Canadian Open, CP matches funds raised for pediatric heart care.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Perhaps most importantly, Ms.¬†Kane has been a role model for Island children for over three decades.

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The African Nova Scotian Decade for People of African Descent Coalition, or DPAD for short, focuses on the historic injustices against Black Canadians in Nova Scotia and current issues related to institutional and systemic racism, and on developing a foundation for future generations.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The organization‚Äôs mission is to build strength and health across communities, and to build a relationship between African Nova Scotians and all levels of government. DPAD advocates for action on pressing current issues, including police brutality, racial profiling, disaggregated data and ensuring African-Nova Scotian voices are represented in government.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Black Canadians have endured a difficult year. On top of a global crisis jeopardizing our health and livelihoods, we have also endured the racial trauma of the murder of many Black people at the hands of police and the echoing impact of injustices. We have been forced to experience the collision of dual pandemics¬†‚Äî racism and COVID-19.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Throughout this time of grief, DPAD has been a stabilizing force. The theme for this year‚Äôs Human Rights Day is ‚ÄúRecover Better¬†‚Äî Stand Up for Human Rights.‚Äù</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >DPAD stands up for African-Nova Scotian rights as we build back better.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I particularly congratulate the staff of this organization, Vanessa Fells and Bernadette Hamilton-Reid, their executive committee and all member organizations that work collectively to lead change.

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I look forward to watching this organization grow in the coming years as they recognize African Nova Scotians as an integral part of Nova Scotia‚Äôs past, present and future.</p>

Leader, it concerns our fellow Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who today marked two years in unlawful detention in China.

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Chinese authorities charged the two Michaels with spying on June¬†18; a year and a half after they were first jailed. This morning, it was reported the Chinese foreign ministry had announced they had been arrested, indicted and tried. It was later reported this was a translation error and that the trial had not yet begun.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Leader, given all the confusion earlier today and the seriousness of their situation, what information can the Government of Canada provide to us on the status of their respective court cases?

Leo Housakos: </b>Honourable senators, my question is for the government leader in the Senate, Senator Gold. On Tuesday, the <i>Washington Post</i> reported that in 2018, Huawei worked with a Chinese artificial intelligence firm to test facial recognition software that could be used to detect Uighur Muslims and sent so-called ‚ÄúUighur alerts‚Äù to government authorities.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This information was contained in an internal Huawei document, and both companies involved, Senator Gold, have acknowledged that the document exists, which has been since pulled from Huawei‚Äôs site, and it is real.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senator Gold, your leader has put out a lengthy statement today in honour of International Human Rights Day, which is appropriate, but it is a statement that makes no mention whatsoever of the Uighur Muslims and their treatment by the Chinese regime. Senator Gold, why does your leader, your government, not seem to care about the human rights violations against Muslim Chinese people? The truth of the matter is, I say, they don‚Äôt care because we‚Äôve seen no action for a number of months. What bearing does this obvious human rights violation have on your government‚Äôs never-ending security review of Huawei‚Äôs participation in Canada‚Äôs 5G network?</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Marc Gold (Government Representative in the Senate): </b> Senator Housakos, thank you for your question. Once again, I have to take issue, respectfully, with your characterization. The government cares enormously about the human rights conditions of the Uighurs. It has been clear in many contexts and, most importantly, directly with its Chinese counterparts.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Again, colleagues, it is facile and perhaps expedient to present these issues in black and white terms, to assume that the measure of a government‚Äôs engagement on such serious, complex issues with its allies and through all channels can be captured in whether or not there is a ringing denunciation in a particular press release. Alas, but happily, in a way¬†‚Äî though not for the two Michaels whose fate remains of paramount concern, as does the fate of all those who suffer oppression and repression throughout the world¬†‚Äî the work of foreign diplomacy, the work of engaging with our allies to achieve results in these cases, is complicated, difficult, protracted and often, as in so many other areas, needs to be done discreetly if it is to be effective.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Senator Housakos: </b>The language your government uses in response to Uighur Muslim people in concentration camps is, in turn, complicated and difficult. The terms I would like to use, Senator Gold, are ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and ‚Äúunacceptable.‚Äù Those are the terms. And if it is so, the government should take action.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senator Gold, there was a lot of disturbing information contained in documents published yesterday concerning the government‚Äôs China policy. For one, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs wrote to the Deputy Minister of National Defence in February¬†2019, ‚ÄúCanada does not want to be the partner that is reducing normal bilateral interactions.¬†.¬†.¬†.‚Äù</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >It is most disturbing that a state that has essentially kidnapped Canadian citizens off the streets was described by our deputy minister as a ‚Äúpartner,‚Äù and it staggers the mind as to what ‚Äúnormal bilateral relations‚Äù might be in the face of a blatant policy of coercion by the Chinese state. The deputy minister goes on to say that his department would not support our military‚Äôs decision not to allow soldiers of the Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army to be here in Canada. It‚Äôs staggering to hear this, but then again Global Affairs seems to be willing to negotiate and talk with anyone, including tyrants.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >My question for you, Senator Gold, is: Did this naive and blatant position of appeasement have the support of your government? A simple ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù will suffice.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Senator Gold: </b>This government is not engaged in a policy of appeasement. Must I repeat myself? I shall. This government has called out China to end its repression of the Uighurs. It has raised this issue directly with Chinese officials and, more recently, with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, along with 39 other member countries of the UN that have expressed their views. This country¬†‚Äî our country¬†‚Äî remains deeply committed to the well-being of the Uighur minority, and it is false and misleading to use terms like ‚Äúappeasement‚Äù to characterize efforts of this government in that regard.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senator, may I also suggest that you mischaracterized or misunderstood what I was trying to say? This is not a question of the words that we use publicly. The actions that this government has taken¬†‚Äî not all of which can be made public, are made public or should be made public¬†‚Äî to secure a better situation for the Uighurs and the release of the two Michaels remain ongoing and consistent.</p>

In 1993, the Canadian International Development Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation asked SEMEX, a leading global livestock genetics company, to execute a bilateral venture with China to develop the Chinese dairy industry in support of expanding the Canadian dairy industry‚Äôs footprint. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In 12 years, Canada helped grow China‚Äôs dairy population from 2.7 million to over 12 million animals today. Canada made an impact on China‚Äôs dairy industry in an extremely significant way. However, in the past two years, SEMEX has faced ongoing challenges for Canadian exports of bovine genetics. Specifically, the export of Canadian dairy and beef bovine semen and embryos has halted as a result of the decision by China in January¬†2019 not to extend the expired import permissions that were previously issued. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As such, SEMEX and its 22,000 Canadian dairy and beef farmers remain at a distinct disadvantage to competitors, namely Americans whose trade remains unaffected despite the fact that their only import licence expired in 2018. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >It is absolutely unacceptable that the Canadian dairy genetics industry be put through additional hardships as they struggle to maintain their genetic exports supply pipeline and lose profitability.

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Diane Bellemare: </b>Honourable senators, my question is for the Government Representative in the Senate.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As you know, Senator Gold, in 2021, the government will be renewing its five-year agreement with the Bank of Canada on the Monetary Policy Framework. The renewal of this agreement, which has been in place since 1991, has so far been primarily initiated by the bank. The bank makes proposals to the government on the mandate, the monetary policy framework and the targets to be met, and it dictates who will assess that policy. This is different from how things are done in the other countries that have served as models for Canada. Governments in other countries take a more active role in the agreement process. For example, in New Zealand, an independent assessment is conducted on the impact and repercussions of the monetary policy that was adopted.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Is the Department of Finance preparing to sign a new agreement and has it conducted an internal or independent assessment of Canada‚Äôs monetary policy, as is done in New Zealand, whose process ours is based on?</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Marc Gold (Government Representative in the Senate): </b>Thank you for the question, senator. As you mentioned, I have been advised that, in support of its mandate, the Bank of Canada is currently putting the final touches on a five-year review of its policy framework. Honourable colleagues, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the day-to-day operations of the bank, but I have been told that the government is satisfied with the bank‚Äôs approach and finds that it‚Äôs working. The Government of Canada will continue to work with the Bank of Canada to address the COVID-19 crisis in order to support the Canadian economy for generations to come.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >On the Order:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >Resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Gagn√©, seconded by the Honourable Senator LaBoucane-Benson, for the second reading of Bill¬†C-17, An Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the federal public administration for the fiscal year ending March¬†31, 2021.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >And on the motion in amendment of the Honourable Senator Pate, seconded by the Honourable Senator McPhedran:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ‚ÄúThat‚Äù and substituting the following therefor:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in;" >‚ÄúBill¬†C-17, <i>An Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the federal public administration for the fiscal year ending March¬†31, 2021</i>, be not now read a second time because the Senate is of the view that it does not include sufficient expenditure to reduce the effects of poverty in Canada, which is currently experienced by more than three and a half million people whose lives have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including high infection rates and ensuing serious illness and death.‚Äù.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Donald Neil Plett (Leader of the Opposition): </b> Your Honour, I have just a few words to say about this. I think it‚Äôs important to put this amendment into context.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As Your Honour said yesterday, the amendment submitted by Senator Pate is a reasoned amendment that would in effect kill Bill¬†C-17.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The reasoned amendment is one of three types of amendment that can be presented at second reading of a bill. It is indeed very rare. In fact, according to the <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i>, Third Edition, 2017, Bosc and Gagnon:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >To date, the House has never decided in favour of a reasoned amendment.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I could not find any precedent of a reasoned amendment adopted by the Senate. This would, therefore, be a first. I don‚Äôt want to debate the reason for the amendment; the fact that the government may not have its priorities in order. I, in fact, agree on that point with Senator Pate, although not for the same reason.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I want to remind senators of our role in Parliament, especially vis-√†-vis supply bills. Senator Pate admitted herself in her speech yesterday that the Senate does not have the constitutional authority to impose upon the house additional expenses. This principle is in conformity with the rules on how the Crown requests and obtains funds, and it is given the authority to raise revenues. These rules go back centuries and are at the heart of our democratic system.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >What Senator Pate is asking us to do is kill Bill¬†C-17 and request that the house authorizes additional expenses before the Senate agrees to pass a supply bill. She is asking us to do indirectly what we cannot do directly. Using a reasoned amendment to kill a bill would be a precedent; it is not something that we should take lightly. Using such a procedural man≈ìuvre to kill a government bill¬†‚Äî a supply bill on top of that¬†‚Äî is crossing a red line for the Senate.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As you may have noticed, I do not have a lot of confidence in the current government and the Prime Minister. But that does not blind me to the fact that I have duties as a senator and parliamentarian to protect how our institutions are run. I therefore cannot support Senator Pate‚Äôs amendment.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Prime Minister and some of his appointees here have claimed that we now have a new Senate. Well, colleagues, I think that the rules and traditions that are the foundation of our democratic and parliamentary systems must be preserved. We should take the opportunity offered by Senator Pate to send a clear message on this. Senators know that there are limits to their power. Senators acknowledge that as unelected parliamentarians they must be cautious when dealing with questions regarding expenses and taxing powers voted by the elected representatives of the people.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >We will therefore, Your Honour and honourable colleagues, ask for a standing vote on this amendment so that all senators have the chance to put their position on this issue on the record.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >We will ask for an hour bell so that all senators can reflect on this important question and have all the time necessary to get into the chamber or on Zoom. Thank you.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Some Hon. Senators: </b>Hear, hear!</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Marilou McPhedran: </b>I appreciate this opportunity to speak briefly on why I seconded Senator Pate‚Äôs amendment and why I sincerely believe it is a reasoned amendment.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As Canada‚Äôs first woman Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland advised in her Fall Economic Statement of November¬†30: </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >As we build back, we have it within our reach to build back better, tackling challenges that hold us all back: Homelessness. Systemic racism. The unfinished and essential work of Reconciliation. The support and investments outlined in this plan, including our stimulus, will foster a resilient and inclusive recovery.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Yesterday, we were advised of the report of the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis, <i>Potential Economic Impacts and Reach of Basic Income Programs in Canada</i> , and again the economic discrimination exposed by this pandemic is confirmed by the evidence in yet another report.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This issue was addressed in the Speech from the Throne with this compelling question. It is highly relevant to senators who have accepted responsibility to bring forth the voices and concerns of minorities that are often lost in high-level decision making and majority votes.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >Do we move Canada forward, or let people be left behind? Do we come out of this stronger, or paper over the cracks that the crisis has exposed?</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As addressed by Senator Pate, women, Indigenous and other racialized peoples and essential yet economically insecure workers remain unsupported by the many legislative measures that we have adopted and are rolling out to support Canadians. About 3.5 million are still lost in the cracks mentioned by our finance minister, and we seem to be doing nothing of substance to reach them and support them. We were promised in the Speech from the Throne:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >It is the job of the federal government to look out for all Canadians and especially our most vulnerable. We need to work together. Beating this virus is a Team Canada effort.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Well, honourable senators, Team Canada seems to be on the bench. The House of Commons is still sitting. The Senate is still sitting. We are all still working. I joined with Senator Pate in bringing attention to the inadequate measures in this bill.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Are we seeing hypocrisy here, or is it as simple as the fact that the most socially and economically vulnerable people in Canada are also often those least able to defend their interests?</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Regardless of the¬†answer, what we do as senators in responding to the government‚Äôs failure in this legislation needs to be on the record. Thank you, merci, <i>meegwetch</i>.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Pierre J. Dalphond: </b>Since we‚Äôre going to have an hour to reflect, let me also provide some comments to help reflection.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senators, I rise to speak to Senator Pate‚Äôs amendment to Bill¬†C-17, called a reasoned amendment in parliamentary practice. At the outset, nobody can deny that Senator Pate is a strong advocate of causes that she endorses, and she does not hesitate to use this place as a platform for recording her strongly held positions. But I‚Äôm afraid her reasoned amendment ventures in dangerous territory, way beyond what the drafters of our Constitution have contemplated for the upper house of our Parliament.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Constitution Act of 1867 provides for two houses in our Parliament: one made of individuals elected by the people and one made of individuals appointed by the Crown. Though our Constitution states that all bills must receive the consent and approval of both chambers and that each chamber can initiate bills, the drafters of our Constitution have enacted an important restriction to the powers and role of the Senate, found at section¬†53 of the Constitution, which reads:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >Bills for appropriating any Part of the Public Revenue, or for imposing any Tax or Impost, shall originate in the House of Commons.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Bill¬†C-17, now before us, is clearly an appropriation bill governed by section¬†53 of the Constitution. The restrictions found in section¬†53 of the Constitution flow from the very well-known principle of ‚Äúno taxation without representation.‚Äù</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In other words, the imposition of taxes and the appropriation of public revenue must rest first and foremost in the hands of those elected by the people.</p>
 <p >(1510)</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Bill¬†C-17 before us has been considered by the representatives of the people and adopted with the support of the majority of MPs representing four of the five political parties in the House of Commons. Now this bill is before us for our review and, possibly, our suggestions for corrections at committee review or at third reading.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senator Pate‚Äôs amendment doesn‚Äôt seek to correct an omission or an oversight, which is possible, but not at second reading. Instead, she wants us to suspend second reading of Bill¬†C-17 until the government implements a basic universal income, a policy that will require months, if not years, of thorough analysis and drafting. In other words, she‚Äôs inviting us to transgress our constitutional role by dictating to the elected government and the elected House of Commons how to appropriate public funds.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >A basic universal income is an idea that many senators have advanced, and I am confident that the Senate will continue to look at issues around it as well as around reformed employment benefits. However, there is a major difference between facilitating debate about such issues and suspending second reading of an appropriation bill until the government enacts a given program. This far exceeds the bounds of the Senate‚Äôs constitutional role of providing sober second thought.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Before concluding, I would like to add some technical comments about the unusual procedural vehicle before us. On page¬†133 of the <i>Senate Procedure in Practice</i>, a ‚Äúreasoned amendment‚Äù is described as follows:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >This amendment allows a senator to state the reasons for opposing second (or third) reading of a bill by introducing another relevant proposal that replaces the original question. In other words, it provides a means to put on the record a statement or explanation as to why a bill should not receive second reading. If the reasoned amendment is adopted, the bill is dropped from the Order Paper. A reasoned amendment always supersedes second (or third) reading.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >It is worth highlighting that this procedural mechanism is very rarely used, as Senator Plett has said, and even more rarely accepted, as he pointed out. He referred to the<i> House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i>. I have the same quote, and certainly concur with him.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I will go further. In a 1946 ruling, finding that a similar amendment was out of order, the then honourable Speaker Senator James King, added: </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >. . . neither in the House of Commons nor in the provincial legislatures has it been the practice to move amendments at the second reading of a bill.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable colleagues, such an amendment is out of place, and I urge you to vote against it. Thank you. <i>Bonne r√©flexion</i>.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Michael Duffy: </b>Honourable senators, I rise today to be brief, as our former colleague Senator Baker used to say. I applaud Senator Pate and other colleagues who have worked so hard on helping Canada‚Äôs poor and vulnerable but, as we‚Äôve heard from Senator Dalphond, there is a difficulty in voting for this motion today. It would pose great problems for the government, so we will have to make allowances for that.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >But that does not mean, Your Honour and colleagues, that there‚Äôs anything wrong with the concept of a guaranteed annual income. In fact, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau‚Äôs Royal Commission on Canada‚Äôs economic prospects, chaired by the late Donald S. Macdonald recommended both free trade with the United States and a guaranteed annual income to help those who lost their jobs as a result of the trade deal.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Macdonald Commission had done extensive studies on the issue, and those studies are publicly available.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In any event, the Macdonald Commission report was released in 1984, just as the new Mulroney government was taking power. They went ahead with free trade but never got to the GAI.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Now, more than 35 years later, on December¬†2, P.E.I.‚Äôs all-party Special Committee on Poverty called on the federal government to partner with Prince Edward Island in such a program to provide a guaranteed annual income or a universal basic income for Islanders. I hope Premier King was able to raise this matter in his meeting today with the Prime Minister and the other first ministers.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This issue has been studied enough. Canadians are ready for a GAI. Thank you, colleagues, for your time and attention.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Some Hon. Senators: </b>Hear, hear.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Leo Housakos: </b>Colleagues, I also want to share my thoughts on this particular issue. I think it‚Äôs an issue that‚Äôs very important and touches a series of elements that are essential to the work we do in this place.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Firstly, I would like to talk about the constitutionality of this motion. I would like to talk about the impact it would have on rules, procedures and precedents. It also touches on the core of what the Westminster model of Parliament is. I would like to weigh in on that as well. I would also like to share some comments with regard to the content and the objective of our honourable colleague Senator Pate, which, of course, is noble and I agree with.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >We all have to acknowledge that the question of poverty in this country should be first and foremost on our minds. We‚Äôve seen over the last few years the growth of that sector of the population, and very little attention has been given to it from this government other than, of course, platitudes in a number of Speeches from the Throne where they continue to promise action, and we‚Äôve seen inaction. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Having said that, of course, I suspect that if we engage in a debate about poverty and how to solve it in this country, probably Senator Pate and I are going to be on different sides of the spectrum about how to do it. But that doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that this institution should be doing it. We should be having these debates. We should be engaging on how to solve what is a menace right now to society and an ever-growing problem, and that is, of course, poverty.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The second element is the constitutionality of what she‚Äôs proposing to do, which is, as my colleagues have pointed out¬†‚Äî Senator Plett very appropriately and Senator Dalphond¬†‚Äî that in the Westminster model of government, it‚Äôs fundamental: there is no taxation without representation, without a doubt. Having said that, at the same time, I want to highlight to colleagues that if you check section¬†18 of the Constitution, it‚Äôs crystal clear that this institution is a parliamentary body that has the same rights, privileges and immunities as the House of Commons does in Westminster. That‚Äôs what this institution was based on.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >At the end of the day, I will quote a giant of this institution, who always used to say, ‚ÄúColleagues, we have the power to approve every piece of legislation; we have the power to defeat every and any piece of legislation.‚Äù That was the Honourable Senator Serge Joyal. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >There is a long-standing precedent, because we are an appointed body and this is a democracy. The Westminster model, despite its sober second chamber being an appointed body, recognizes the fact that this is not a place of confidence. At the end of the day, we don‚Äôt have the authority to compel the government in order to carry through expenditures, particularly on supply bills.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >But we do have the authority as senators to amend bills. We have the authority to, for example, add addenda to studies done by finance committees. We have all that opportunity when we are dealing with supply bills.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >But I also want to draw attention, colleagues, to an ever-growing problem that I foresee happening, and we‚Äôre seeing it at various crossroads, which is this government‚Äôs feeble and poorly thought out attempt to reform this institution by giving the impression that somehow senators cannot work within the confines of caucuses and the government-opposition structure of the Westminster model. We‚Äôve seen time and time again that it runs into obstacles and difficulties. Because, at the end of the day, there‚Äôs a number of senators who believe the Prime Minister when he says they have absolute independence. And this government, as we‚Äôve seen recently in the response yesterday from the government leader, Senator Gold, getting up in total indignation at the actions taken by senators who felt they were acting independently of the government and basically articulating a point of view that they have the right to articulate.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Having said that, as I said, I agree they went a bit far, Senator Gold, in terms of a reasoned amendment, which is unprecedented; it has never happened. And I totally disagree with that. However, senators do have the right to amend even a supply bill. They have a right to question it and to challenge it. </p>
 <p >(1520)</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The point I want to make is that this place has been neutered and hindered. Many independent senators have been hindered with regard to the opportunity to do some of the work we used to do in the Senate, before we adopted this new model, Senator Gold. Once upon a time, government-appointed senators had the opportunity in relation to pre-budget studies, which often take place at national caucus and at advisory committee groups of the governing caucus.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senators did some of their most important work on behalf of their provinces and regions, and had a lot of influence, in terms of putting together budgets and programs. In this particular case, Senator McPhedran and Senator Pate would be great champions in terms of articulating on behalf of poverty groups in this country.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >We do have the opportunity in the Westminster model for the opposition to oppose, and we should have the opportunity for government-appointed senators to influence important decisions, including supply bills, at the preliminary and pre-study stages. Unfortunately, the chamber has been neutered of that right and privilege by this Prime Minister. This amendment has highlighted some of the difficulties that have been created as a result.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Having said that, again I highlight that our colleagues have the right to speak on behalf of these stakeholders and this particular group in the country, and they have the right to amend the bill. Unfortunately, with regret to my colleagues, I think they have gone a bit too far and against the rules that the Constitution calls for, under which the chamber has the privilege to work. Thank you.</p>

For that reason, I would hope that, when we come to the vote, we can do it as expeditiously as possible¬†‚Äî perhaps to vote right away, if there is even a need for a standing vote¬†‚Äî rather than to waste more time, as we have seen in recent days with unnecessary votes. I hope we can get to the vote now and that we do it as expeditiously as possible. Thank you, Your Honour.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Senator Gagn√©: </b>Honourable senators, thank you for this opportunity to provide an overview of the 2020-21 Supplementary Estimates (B). As honourable senators are aware, these supplementary estimates outline the government‚Äôs incremental spending plans. These, of course, are in addition to the Main Estimates for the year, which were tabled this past February, and the Supplementary Estimates (A), which were tabled in June.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This year, the President of the Treasury Board tabled the Supplementary Estimates (B) for 2020-21 on October¬†22 in the House of Commons. They present information on spending requirements across federal organizations that were either not sufficiently developed in time for inclusion in the Main Estimates or have been refined to account for developments in certain programs and services. They also include a summary of the government‚Äôs incremental financial requirements as well as an overview of major funding requests and horizontal initiatives.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Colleagues, in our parliamentary system, the estimates are a cornerstone of government accountability.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Canadians and the parliamentarians who represent them have the right to know how public funds are spent and to hold the government to account. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The information contained in the supplementary estimates ensures ongoing transparency and accountability on the use of public funds to deliver programs and services to Canadians and, in accordance with the government‚Äôs commitment to transparency, Supplementary Estimates (B), 2020-21 continues to report on the spending authorized by the emergency response legislation associated with COVID-19 in order to provide critical programs and services to Canadians.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, the government continues to invest in people, the economy and COVID-19-related support in order to ensure Canada‚Äôs success and economic recovery.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >[<i>English</i>]</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As we work to recover and restart the economy, we are all relearning what it means to live and work safely. COVID-19 forced the government to quickly shift its focus to roll out critical services and supports to Canadians in record time. This was undertaken by a workforce which, in a matter of a few short days, had pivoted to remote work.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >It was a Herculean effort. Normally it would have taken months, but this was done in a matter of weeks.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >[<i>English</i>]</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The large-scale shift of the federal workforce to home offices has certainly had its share of challenges for our public servants. But Shared Services Canada quickly adapted to support this change by increasing network capacity and introducing collaborative tools for public servants to work together effectively outside of an office setting. This back-end support allowed public servants to deliver critical information, programs and services to Canadians during an extremely challenging and uncertain time.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The government quickly rolled out key support services like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. As well, it built tools to help Canadians stay informed about COVID-19 and the government supports available to them.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Importantly, colleagues, the government also benefited by working in collaboration with its international and private sector partners. For example, Canada‚Äôs new notification service ‚ÄúGet Updates on COVID-19‚Äù was built using open source code from the U.K.‚Äôs Digital Government Service and has sent over 5 million important messages to Canadians by text or email since April.</p>
 <p >(1750)</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This includes the launch of COVID Alert, a smartphone notification app that informs Canadians of potential exposure to the virus without sharing any personal information with other users, private interests or government institutions. I strongly encourage all honourable senators to download the app, if they haven‚Äôt already done so, to help do their part.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >[<i>Translation</i>]</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Canada‚Äôs response to the pandemic inspired confidence in the government‚Äôs capacity to react decisively and effectively to serve Canadians in times of crisis.

Through these estimates, the government is seeking Parliament‚Äôs approval of $20.9 billion in planned spending for this fiscal year. Changes in planned spending are presented for 83 federal organizations, of which 71 require parliamentary approval of new spending. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As I will cover in a moment, honourable senators, these estimates lay out spending plans that further address the health and economic impacts of COVID-19. They also present statutory forecasts for these same items, pursuant to the Public Health Events of National Concern Payments Act, which will be repealed on December¬†31, and provisions in the Financial Administration Act authorizing payments to the provinces and territories, which were repealed on September¬†30. Overall, funding requirements for the top 10 organizations account for approximately 85.5% of the voted spending sought through these estimates.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As honourable senators might expect, the organization with the most amount of funding, $9.3 billion, is the Public Health Agency of Canada. That includes $5.3 billion for medical research and vaccine developments, as well as $2.2 billion for protective and medical gear for our front-line workers. There is also $783 million for medical countermeasures to help secure and enhance domestic biomanufacturing capacity to obtain a sufficient supply of packaging materials for the COVID-19 vaccine. This will allow us to secure mass vaccination equipment and build capacity for successful vaccine deployment. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Department of Finance is seeking a total of $3.3 billion, including $1 billion for provinces and territories to help cover the costs of adapting the education sector to ensure a safe return to class throughout the school year. Another $1 billion is for the Government of Alberta to close inactive oil and gas wells and rehabilitate the well sites. Funding for the Safe Restart Agreement is $700 million, which supports provinces and territories in safely restarting their economies and preparing for possible future waves of the virus.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Funding in these estimates will help provinces and territories increase their capacity to conduct testing, perform contact tracing and share public health data that will help fight the pandemic.

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >On the Order:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >Resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Gagn√©, seconded by the Honourable Senator Gold, P.C., for the third reading of Bill¬†C-17, An Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for the federal public administration for the fiscal year ending March¬†31, 2021.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Elizabeth Marshall: </b>Honourable senators, I would like to thank Senator Gagn√© for her comments on Bill¬†C-17. In this bill, the government is requesting $21 billion. However, Supplementary Estimates (B), which support this bill, also outline $59 billion in statutory spending. This $59 billion in statutory spending has already been approved by existing legislation. For example, $29 billion for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB, was approved by the Public Health Events of National Concern Payments Act, enacted last March. Almost all of the $59 billion in statutory spending is COVID related. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Of the $21 billion requested in Bill¬†C-17, $15.5 billion is COVID related. The Public Health Agency of Canada is requesting $9 billion of the $21 billion. Of this amount, $5.3 billion is for medical research and vaccine development, while $2.2 billion is for protective gear and medical equipment. The remaining $1.4 billion is for a variety of items, including border and travel measures and isolation sites at $196 million, development of a COVID-19 vaccine at $46 million, five respirators at $6.4 million and Kids Help Phone at $3.3 million.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In addition, $8.7 billion has already received approval under the Public Health Events of National Concern Payments Act. Included in this $8.7 billion was $3.8 billion for medical research and vaccine developments and $3.3 billion for protective gear and medical equipment.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Given the extent of funding for vaccines in Supplementary Estimates (B), there was a significant amount of interest expressed by senators during Finance Committee meetings regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. Officials from the Public Health Agency informed us that government has signed agreements to secure what they refer to as tens of millions of vaccine doses. The three most promising at the time of the committee hearings were Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. At the time of our study, public health officials also said the agency was expecting doses to start coming into the country likely in January¬†and February. However, no vaccine numbers were provided to the committee.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Officials further indicated that there is no order-of-country priority stipulated in the contracts for the vaccines. We are now seeing small amounts of vaccines coming into the country for distribution. Vaccine availability and distribution will continue to be a subject of discussion.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >For example, my province is 1 of 14 distribution sites, and we expect to receive 1,950 vaccines around December¬†14. I expect additional vaccine funding to appear in Supplementary Estimates (C).</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Department of Finance is requesting $3.2 billion, of which $1 billion is for the Safe Return to Class Fund, $1 billion is for the Province of Alberta to clean up inactive oil and gas wells and $700 million is for the Safe Restart Agreement.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The $1 billion requested for the Safe Return to Class Fund is part of a $2-billion program to help provinces and territories cover the costs of adapting the education sector to ensure a safe return to class and cover costs related to increased hand sanitization and hygiene, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Another $1 billion for the Safe Return to Class Fund was already approved under the authority of the Financial Administration Act. It is disclosed in the Supplementary Estimates (B) document as a statutory item, the Financial Administration Act being the relevant authority.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Since that section¬†of the Financial Administration Act was repealed on September¬†30, it required the second instalment of $1 billion to be requested in a supply bill.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As I indicated previously, the Department of Finance is requesting $700 million for the Safe Restart Agreement. The Safe Restart Agreement is a $19-billion program, which supports all of the provinces and territories in restarting their economies, notably in the areas of health care, testing and contact tracing support, child care, sick leave, municipalities and personal protective equipment procurement.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >While $700 million is being requested by the Department of Finance in this supply bill, the department has already been provided with $12.2 billion as a statutory amount under the authority of the Financial Administration Act.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >However, that section¬†of the Financial Administration Act was repealed on September¬†30. Any payments after that date must be approved by a supply bill.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Department of Health is also requesting $315 million for the Safe Restart Agreement, while $18.5 billion payments have already been approved under the Public Health Events of National Concern Payments Act.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Tracking the funding for the Safe Restart Agreement has presented its challenges because funding for the agreement is included in two departments, and within each of those departments, some funding is being requested in the supply bill while other funding has already been approved by the Public Health Events of National Concern Payments Act and the Financial Administration Act.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Department of Finance is also requesting $461 million for the Essential Worker Support Program. This is a $3-billion program, of which $2.5 billion has already been drawn down by the provinces. This $461 million is the remaining instalment.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Department of Health is also requesting $737 million, of which $319 million is for medical research related to COVID-19, $315 million is for the Safe Restart Program and $100 million is for drugs, medical devices and virtual care.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Of interest, officials told us that before the pandemic, 5% of visits with doctors and other health care providers were virtual. This has increased to over half of interactions with health care providers now being done by phone, video conferencing or by other virtual means.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Department of Transport is requesting $516 million in this supply bill. The largest item is $180 million for the purchase and refit of the marine vessel <i>Villa de Teror</i>. The purchase cost is $155 million and refit costs are estimated at $25 million.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This vessel was acquired to provide ferry service to the residents of √éles de la Madeleine. It will be retrofitted and will provide service during the summers of 2021 until 2026.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Officials assured us that these were the final costs associated with the <i>Villa de Teror</i>. Some senators were interested in the cost of the acquisition and retrofitting of the <i>Villa de Teror</i> because some jurisdictions, when acquiring used marine vessels, significantly underestimate the retrofitting costs. My province is one of those jurisdictions. The cost of the <i>Villa de Teror</i> will be followed up when we study future estimates.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, as I mentioned earlier, $15.5 billion of the $21 billion in this bill is COVID related. Of the $59 billion in statutory expenditures in Supplementary Estimates (B), almost all is COVID related. I will have further comments on COVID-related expenditures when I speak to Bill¬†C-16 later this evening.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues on the National Finance Committee for their probing questions during committee meetings, as well as to our chair, Senator Mockler, deputy chairs, Senator Forest and Senator Klyne and, of course, the fourth member of our steering committee, Senator Richards.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I also express my appreciation to officials and staff for their hard work and support during discussions of these expenditure items. Thank you, honourable, colleagues.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >C-17 includes a program expenditure to allocate to the Department of Finance a $1 billion sum, provided to the Government of Alberta to ‚Äúclose inactive oil and gas wells and rehabilitate the well sites.‚Äù</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Section¬†7.5 of the Senate Standing Committee on National Finance report hints at the fact that the orphan and abandoned wells issue is extremely complex. There is uncertainty regarding when and how the wells will be remediated and how this will result in job creation.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I wish to focus my remarks on this particular aspect of Bill¬†C-17 that I found to be poorly understood, poorly communicated and lacking transparency.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This is the final instalment of the government support announced in April¬†2020, of a $1.7 billion transfer to Western provincial governments to help cover the costs of remediating the ever-growing number of inactive and orphan wells. This is the single largest COVID-19 pandemic support package given to a specific industrial sector to date.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >While I rejoice that the federal government prioritizes remediation efforts, I have concerns about the program‚Äôs design and the lack of strings attached.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Since this money serves to cover remediation obligations of the fossil fuel sector, we can consider this support to be another form of subsidy of this industry.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Yesterday we heard Senators Mockler and Pate explaining, with passion, that millions of citizens living below the poverty line did not receive financial assistance. Meanwhile, the petroleum industry has received this generous subsidy, giving further evidence to support claims that there is socialism for certain corporations and capitalism for the poor.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As you may or may not know, there are 450,000 oil and gas wells in Alberta, of which over a third are abandoned. They are inactive and have yet to be remediated. A subset of all of these wells are owned by companies that have become defunct and are no longer able to repair the damage their well has caused to the environment or to the landowner from whom they leased the land. These are orphan wells, of which there are 5,650 across the country.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Oil and gas companies are legally obligated to remediate their wells, but are often not required to put the money aside as insurance, from the beginning of the operations, as is now required of the mining industry in some provinces. This allows corporations to shirk their remediation obligations by going bankrupt and reincorporating into a new form¬†‚Äî abandoning their wells and jeopardizing the health and safety of humans and ecosystems.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In Alberta, when industry is not able to remediate these wells, the cost is transferred to the Orphan Well Association.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This association is funded through industry contributions. However, at the current rate of contributions to this fund, my office estimates it would take almost 160 years to clean up existing abandoned wells, soon to be major liabilities.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Ultimately, as is the case with the $1.7 billion in federal support, there is a real risk this liability will fall back on the public, as only $200 million provided to the Orphan Well Association is meant to be repaid.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >When the government takes steps to reduce the adverse impacts of resource extraction, it is true that it is protecting our local communities, our farms and our environment. However, the it is not following one fundamental principle of social justice, the polluter-pays principle. The industry generates pollution and governments subsidize the clean-up costs that result from their carelessness.</p>

Despite being legally responsible, these companies have set aside a very small fraction of the anticipated costs, and the full burden will inevitably fall on taxpayers, exactly as the Auditor General of Alberta pointed out in his 2015 report.</p>

To address some of these issues, the government had initiated an estimates reform project in recent years but has now cancelled or discontinued the project.

Honourable colleagues will recall that I previously indicated on numerous occasions that the government has failed to provide parliamentarians with the financial information they need to provide parliamentary oversight. Information that is provided is often dated, disjointed and provided in various locations, and information is often simply not provided.

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >On November¬†12, the Minister of Finance appeared before the National Finance Committee to discuss Bill¬†C-9. At that time, I indicated to her that there was no requirement within that bill to publicly provide any financial or program information on the two programs, which were the subject of the bill, specifically, the wage subsidy program and the rent subsidy program.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I also told her that the biweekly COVID reports, which had provided some information on the COVID-19 programs, were discontinued on August¬†6 and that program and financial information were very much lacking. In fact, I told her that the lack of program and financial information is the biggest issue I have.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The President of the Treasury Board also appeared before the National Finance Committee on December¬†1 to discuss the Main Estimates and Supplementary Estimates (B). At that time, I asked him why he had not provided us with all the financial information we need as parliamentarians to do our jobs.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The estimates documents, which were the subject of those discussions, do not provide estimates of all government spending, and in order to track expenditures and match them up with the estimates or vice versa, we have to research <i>The Fiscal Monitor</i>, ministerial remarks, websites of Crown corporations, proceedings of committees of the House of Commons, reports of the Parliamentary Budget Officer and so on. Neither the Minister of Finance nor the Treasury Board President satisfactorily responded to my questions.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >While Supplementary Estimates (B), and Supplementary Estimates (A) before them, include many COVID-19-related expenditures, it is not a complete accounting of these expenditures. I would like to summarize some of the problems encountered.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Department of Employment and Social Development is requesting $28 billion for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB, as we call it, in Supplementary Estimates (B). This is in addition to the $60 billion approved in Supplementary Estimates (A), for a total estimated cost of $88 billion.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >However, CERB was transitioned to the EI program in September. The most recent <i>Fiscal Monitor</i> provided by the Department of Finance for September¬†has now split the cost of the CERB program so that payments to individuals eligible for EI previously reported as CERB have now been reclassified as Employment Insurance benefits. While Supplementary Estimates (A) and (B) enable us to track the estimated cost of the CERB program, as well as program information such as the number of applicants, et¬†cetera, this information is no longer being disclosed as of September¬†30.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Another example occurred last month when we passed Bill¬†C-9, which authorized two COVID-19 programs: The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy. The costs of these programs do not show up in the supplementary estimates because they are considered tax expenditures. High-level information on the wage subsidy program is disclosed in <i>The Fiscal Monitor</i> and on the Canada Revenue Agency website, but there is no information on the rent subsidy program in either <i>The Fiscal Monitor</i> or on the Canada Revenue Agency website.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >A third example is the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, which was administered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. It was announced in April¬†and was initially estimated to cost $3 billion, but as of July, only $367 million of the $3 billion had been allocated. The last COVID-19 biweekly report in August¬†indicated $644 million had been allocated to businesses, and then I saw nothing until I saw a press release on November¬†2, which stated that $2 billion had been paid to assist 138,000 businesses. However, there was no program or financial information available on an ongoing basis. This lack of information was raised with CMHC officials when they testified on Bill¬†C-9. They indicated that they had met their reporting obligations by daily reporting to the Department of Finance and the Privy Council Office and weekly reporting to the provinces and territories. There is no consideration for giving information to parliamentarians.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Since the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy program will now be administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, their officials assured us at committee that they would be providing information similar to the wage subsidy program. However, this information has yet to appear on their website.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, given the lack of information being provided by government, many parliamentarians are turning to the Parliamentary Budget Officer for information. Last month, the Parliamentary Budget Officer released a report on Supplementary Estimates (B). In that report, he concludes that:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >. . . the amount of information that is publicly available to track this spending is lacking, thus making it more challenging for parliamentarians to perform their critical role in overseeing Government spending and holding it to account. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >He further concludes that:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >. . . there is currently no public document published by the Government which provides a complete list of all measures announced to date, or updated cost estimates. There is also no consistency to which organizations publicly report on the implementation of these measures.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In addition, the supplementary estimates that we studied at the Finance Committee do not include all the planned spending, since the document only provides details of organizations which make payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>
 <p >(1950)</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Some of the measures not included in Supplementary Estimates (B) are the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, the Business Credit Availability Program, the Canada Emergency Business Account, the enhanced benefits provided through the Employment Insurance Operating Account and the new benefits enacted in October¬†2020 through the Canada Recovery Benefits Act.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In his report on Supplementary Estimates (B), the Parliamentary Budget Officer makes an interesting observation. He discloses that: </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >While not all COVID spending is made public, federal departments and agencies are required to update the Government‚Äôs Central Financial Management and Reporting System with actual spending data on a monthly basis.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In other words, the information that I‚Äôm looking for as a parliamentarian is available. The government just isn‚Äôt providing it.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In addition to the direct COVID-19 spending reflected in Supplementary Estimates (A) and now Supplementary Estimates (B), the government has also provided liquidity support measures to targeted populations, many of which are delivered through Crown corporations.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >These measures would include loans, guarantees and deferred tax payments and are generally repayable. However, they do impact the government‚Äôs exposure to risk because government is the sole shareholder of each of these corporations. Any gains or losses in these Crown corporation programs could affect the federal government‚Äôs bottom line. There are currently five Crown corporations providing liquidity support: The Bank of Canada, Farm Credit Canada, Export Development Canada, Business Development Bank of Canada and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Bank of Canada has put in place a number of COVID-19 programs for the federal government, the provinces, financial institutions and corporations, primarily to provide liquidity. However, the Bank of Canada is unique in that it publicly reports on a weekly basis the status of its liquidity supports. So the weekly growth in the Bank of Canada‚Äôs balance sheet as a result of their COVID-19 programs is easily accessible on their website, and officials are available to¬†answer inquiries.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Information on the COVID-19 programs of the other four Crown corporations had been provided in the biweekly COVID-19 reports. However, as noted previously, the government ceased providing this information as of August¬†6. As a result, financial and program information on the COVID-19 programs of these Crown corporations is lacking.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In October, the Parliamentary Budget Officer released a report on Crown corporations‚Äô COVID-19 liquidity support, indicating that the increases in liquidity supports by those four Crown corporations have provoked questions from several parliamentarians regarding the budgetary risks associated with these financial commitments.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In his report, the Parliamentary Budget Officer indicated that the liquidity supports for the Crown corporations¬†‚Äî and I‚Äôm not referring to the Bank of Canada here but the other four Crown corporations¬†‚Äî represent extraordinarily large expansions of their financial operations in the billions of dollars. He concluded that the public reporting on the probable or potential budgetary costs of these liquidity supports has been lacking.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >He also said that the government, within its economic and fiscal snapshot in July¬†‚Äî the current fiscal update came after this report¬†‚Äî included estimates for the net profits or losses expected on these liquidity measures but they were combined with other activities, so there was only a net amount.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >He went on to say that, upon request, Finance Canada provided him with the five-year profile for aggregate gains and losses for enterprise Crown corporations on a confidential basis. In other words, additional information is available but, again, it will not be provided to parliamentarians.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, last weekend, I read an article¬†about a CBC investigation¬†‚Äî and I have read several since then¬†‚Äî on the billions of dollars that the federal government handed out during the first eight months of the pandemic and the lack of details surrounding the programs. The article¬†indicated that CBC had compiled the figures from federal government websites, corporate financial reports, the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, and through access-to-information requests. Yes, I can confirm that the CBC did not get¬†all their information from the Government of Canada, because the government quite simply has refused to disclose it.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Kevin Page, our former Parliamentary Budget Officer and now head of the University of Ottawa‚Äôs Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy, says that the numbers disclosed in November‚Äôs fiscal update are estimated numbers and not the actual monies that are going out the door.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable colleagues, I have been requesting program and financial information on the COVID-19 programs for several months. CBC‚Äôs investigation included a search of corporate reports filed by 2,000 corporations. I have made several conclusions based on those reports.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The CBC article¬†also cited costs associated with PPE-related expenditures and cites costs per type of equipment. It is a sad state of affairs when parliamentarians have to resort to CBC to obtain information on COVID-19 spending.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >CBC related an interesting exercise in their article¬†with which I can relate. For example, in seeking information on the ‚Äúone-time, tax-free payment for seniors,‚Äù CBC said they had to follow a maze of websites of the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, spreadsheets and legislative costing notices that provided three different totals for the program, ranging from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. That is the sort of exercise I do when I‚Äôm trying to track expenditures. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >That experience is consistent with my experiences when information has to be gleaned from the website of the Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the departmental website, Crown corporation websites, ministerial briefing notes and other sources deemed reliable.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Even former Parliamentary Budget Officer Kevin Page, who worked within government for many years, says he can hardly make sense of the recent 223-page¬†fall economic update. He said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to read. I have done this for years and I can‚Äôt even follow the money.‚Äù He wonders if someone in government is actually trying to obscure the data. ‚ÄúI hope it‚Äôs not deliberate,‚Äù he said.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In closing, I refer my honourable colleagues to the Finance Committee report on Bill¬†C-9, which was adopted last month, and our report on Main Estimates and Supplementary Estimates (B), adopted by the Senate yesterday.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Finance Committee, in reporting on Bill¬†C-9, recommended that the government reinstate the publication of the biweekly COVID-19 report and publish timely, monthly updates on all of its COVID-19 programs. The Finance Committee also recommended that the government identify indicators to assess the performance of its financial support programs, providing timely and meaningful data on actual results.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Finance Committee report on Main Estimates and Supplementary Estimates (B), which was approved yesterday, further recommends that the federal government provide clear and consistent monthly reports on the costs and performance of all its COVID-19 programs.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, it is time for the federal government to implement the recommendations of the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. Parliamentarians and Canadians should not have to seek this information from sources outside government.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In closing, I refer colleagues to the Finance Committee report on Bill¬†C-9 and our report on Main Estimates, adopted by the Senate yesterday.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, the government should stop talking about transparency of spending and start being transparent about its spending. Thank you very much.</p>

This report lists the acts of Parliament or provisions of acts of Parliament not yet in force that were enacted nine years or more before December¬†31 of the previous calendar year. However, these acts and provisions can be saved from automatic repeal if they are brought into force before December¬†31 or if one of the Houses of Parliament adopts a resolution exempting them from repeal.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The first recommendation has to do with several provisions of An Act to amend certain Acts in relation to financial institutions. These provisions amend the definition of ‚Äúsolicitation‚Äù in the Bank Act, the Insurance Companies Act and the Trust and Loan Companies Act. A deferral of repeal of these provisions is recommended so that the government has time to adopt the proposed legislative amendments.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The second recommendation has to do with several provisions of An Act to amend the law governing financial institutions and to provide for related and consequential matters. Section¬†28 of this act has to do with the special security regime in the Bank Act. A deferral of repeal of these provisions is recommended so that the Department of Finance can consult stakeholders to assess the need to modernize the special security regime and the potential repercussions of the repeal of this section.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" > The remaining not-in-force provisions amend the corresponding sections of the Bank Act, the Cooperative Credit Associations Act and the Trust and Loan Companies Act in order to require that financial institutions try to contact the holders of unclaimed balances by e-mail, in addition to the existing requirement that they send a notice to the holder‚Äôs address on file. A deferral of repeal of these provisions is recommended until the legislative amendments are implemented, as announced in Budget 2019.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Minister of Finance‚Äôs third recommendation has to do with certain provisions of the Payment Card Networks Act. Sections 6 and 7 of this act authorize the Governor-in-Council to make regulations respecting the operation of payment card networks and the behaviour of their operators in order to promote fair and transparent business practices. It is recommended that the repeal be deferred because more time is needed to complete the work and the consultations on the approach.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Minister of Foreign Affairs is recommending deferrals of repeal for one act. The deferral recommendation concerns the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Implementation Act. This act will be brought into force as soon as the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty enters into force. However, before the treaty enters into force, it requires ratification by 44 specific states. Currently, 8 out of these 44 states have not yet ratified the treaty. The act will implement the treaty once its entry into force is achieved.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry is recommending deferrals of repeal of certain provisions of one act. The deferral recommendation concerns an act better known as Canada‚Äôs anti-spam legislation but which is entitled An Act to promote the efficiency and adaptability of the Canadian economy by regulating certain activities that discourage reliance on electronic means of carrying out commercial activities, and to amend the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act, the Competition Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and the Telecommunications Act.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >This act prohibits, among other things, sending unsolicited commercial electronic messages, altering transmission data and installing computer programs, such as malware, without consent. The provisions for which a deferral of repeal is requested create a private right of action, allowing any person affected by a violation of the act to apply to the courts for compensation for loss or damage suffered or expenses incurred and for statutory damages.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The coming-into-force of these provisions was suspended by order-in-council pending a review of the act to provide greater legal certainty for the numerous stakeholders, given the uncertainty surrounding the interpretation of several of its provisions. A deferral of repeal is therefore recommended until the government has completed its review of the act.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The first recommendation pertains to the provisions of the Contraventions Act. This act establishes an alternative to summary conviction under the Criminal Code for the prosecution of federal offences that are designated as contraventions. The Department of Justice entered into agreements with every province, with the exception of Alberta and Saskatchewan, to implement the ticketing regime through provincial regimes already in place for criminal matters. The Department of Justice also intends to initiate negotiations for implementation in the territories once the regime is implemented in the two remaining provinces.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" > In the event that these negotiations do not succeed, the Department of Justice will reassess the need to implement an independent federal regime in these jurisdictions by applying the provisions of the act not yet in force. The deferral of the repeal is therefore being recommended in the event that an independent federal regime must be put in place.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The second recommendation pertains to three provisions of the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act, which are not yet in force. These provisions would allow for regulations to expand the categories of parents to whom EI parental benefits are paid, in situations where legal parentage could be denied under provincial or territorial law. Although the initial intention was to have these provisions go into force and to make regulations to deal with these situations, it was instead decided that the provinces and territories would be allowed to remedy this shortcoming, and to have these federal provisions go into force only if necessary. Over the years, many provinces and territories updated their legislation to bring it in line with the Charter, but some have not yet done so.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >A deferral of repeal is recommended to allow the Government of Canada to complete the review of the parental benefit provisions in order to determine whether the provincial and territorial legislation has advanced to the point where deferring repeal of the provisions in question would no longer be necessary.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >The Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act has never come into force. The Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No.¬†2, enacts the Pay Equity Act to replace the Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >A deferral of the repeal of section¬†399 is recommended so that it can be done at the same time as the repeal of the Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act.</p>

Thanks to the quiet work of our member of Parliament and deputy prime minister at the time, Erik Nielsen, in the mid-1980s the territories received a formula finance funding arrangement, similar to provincial equalization formula and payments. It was a major step forward for both territories.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Another major milestone occurred in 2001, with the Devolution Transfer Agreement, the bill referenced in this Motion No.¬†22. For senators who weren‚Äôt in the chamber at the time, the devolution agreement between Canada and Yukon was the transfer of care and control over land and resources to the Yukon. I travelled to Ottawa in my capacity as leader of the third party in the Yukon legislature, part of a Yukon all-party effort to persuade members of Parliament to approve the Devolution Transfer Agreement, Bill¬†C-39. I do not recall any one of us seeking an audience with senators. Now I know better.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >It was my great honour and privilege, as Yukon‚Äôs premier, to sign that final Devolution Transfer Agreement. We truly became the masters and mistresses of our own house.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Some of the specific provisions addressed today are to do with the Auditor General of Canada. As Senator Gagn√© noted, until such time as Yukon appoints an auditor general, the Auditor General of Canada maintains responsibility. Quite frankly, as I mentioned earlier, Yukon, Canada and territorial, provincial and Indigenous governments have other priorities than appointing an auditor general, and we remain truly appreciative of the Auditor General of Canada‚Äôs work on our behalf. The work, Senator Marshall, is still underway, and close scrutiny is offered to financial expenditures in the territories.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I would like to address the Yukon Surface Rights Board Act provisions, which are also contained in this motion.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, Canada‚Äôs Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, Ministers Freeland, Bennett, Vandal, Monsef, Joly, her parliamentary secretary and our Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell, to name a few, Premier Sandy Silver and his cabinet and caucus, Grand Chief Peter Johnston and Yukon First Nations chiefs with self-government agreements and those without, work diligently with one another to ensure the best government for all citizens. The strong government¬†‚Äî Canada to Yukon, government to government, Canada to Yukon and to First Nation government relations, that government to government to government relations that exists in the Yukon¬†‚Äî sets a gold standard for our fellow Canadians.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >For these reasons, and knowing that these provisions on the Yukon Surface Rights Board would not have been brought forward without this strong relationship and the strong consultative process it includes, I‚Äôm quite comfortable in commending this motion to the chamber.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, I appreciate that the air time in this chamber is much in demand and I thank you for your time and consideration in allowing me to make these remarks and to express my support for Motion No.¬†22.</p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >She said: Honourable senators, I wish to initiate debate on this inquiry, and this will allow time for those senators who, due to time constraints, were unable to pay tribute to our former colleague the Honourable Senator Lillian Dyck in the time that had been allocated for tributes. Thank you.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Yvonne Boyer: </b>Honourable senators, I would like to pay tribute to Senator Lillian Dyck, a person who laid the groundwork for a better future for Indigenous women.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >When Senator Dyck was called to the Senate, she immediately recognized the need for diversity in the upper chamber and believed it was her duty to accept it. She wasn‚Äôt afraid to take on this role and become the change that she wanted to see. Senator Dyck was the first woman from a First Nation and the first Canadian-born person of Chinese descent to be appointed to the Senate. Now she‚Äôs also the first Indigenous woman to retire from the Senate. She has rightfully earned the title of ‚Äútrailblazer.‚Äù</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >For over 15 years, Senator Dyck has represented the province of Saskatchewan¬†‚Äî my home province¬†‚Äî and has been an outspoken advocate for human rights, particularly the rights of Indigenous women and Chinese Canadians. She pushed against racist laws that discriminated against Chinese people and fought for stiffer penalties in domestic violence cases involving Indigenous women. She was also involved in the passing of Bill¬†S-3, a bill that addressed the sex-based inequalities of the Indian Act and allowed Indigenous women to pass their status on to their children. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >She chaired the Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples from 2015 to 2019, and has advocated for better education for Indigenous students. For the past 10 years, she has tirelessly fought for justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and their families. She has accomplished great things, but she also had to overcome many barriers.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As a woman of both Cree and Chinese descent, Lillian Dyck has endured sexism and racism throughout her life. She remembers her mother telling her not to tell anyone that she was Indigenous, not to visit the George Gordon First Nation and to ‚Äúforget about them.‚Äù Her life story has inspired many, including Indigenous playwright Kenneth Williams, who wrote the play <i>Caf√© Daughter</i> to honour her journey and raise public awareness of the difficult realities faced by Indigenous people and Chinese Canadians. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senator Dyck‚Äôs identity as a Cree-Chinese-Canadian woman was once regarded as an obstacle, but now we see it gave her an incredible, unique voice. She reminds us that the Senate should be a place where different perspectives are represented and valued, where sober second thought really means including everyone. Senator Dyck once said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt just live for yourself. You live for those around you.‚Äù </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >What an example you have set, my friend, and in doing so, you have led us all towards a brighter future. Thank you for your incredible contributions to the Senate of Canada. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Good health, and travel safely, Senator Dyck.<i> Meegwetch</i>. Thank you.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Marilou McPhedran: </b>Honourable senators, I am moved and honoured to pay tribute on the retirement of Senator Lillian Eva Quan Dyck of the McNabs from the Gordon First Nation, Saskatchewan, and the first-generation Canadian daughter of a father who immigrated to Canada in 1912 from China and had to pay the head tax, equivalent to two years‚Äô earnings at the time.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >We have heard that Dr.¬†Dyck was a pioneer among Aboriginal women in Canada in many ways celebrated by previous speakers, so I will just note that her impressive list of accomplishments includes attaining her doctorate and building her academic career in the sciences, honing the astute and incisive analytical skills she later brought here to the Senate. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >I remember her beauty, dignity and humility when she was presented with a lifetime achievement award by Indspire. Just last year, she received a Women of Distinction Lifetime Achievement award from the YWCA in her home city, beautiful Saskatoon, just one of the many recognitions so rightfully flowing to her that I am sure will continue.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Alongside her research and academic work, the Honourable Dr.¬†Lillian Eva Quan Dyck has remained available and responsive in setting a very high standard of public service. Just this week, I received an email from her with information that I found to be helpful. Senator Plett had us chuckling when he reminisced about Senator Dyck‚Äôs stern finger wagging, and I too know what it feels like to earn her disapproval. With gratitude and some considerable relief, I can report that so far, Lillian has eventually forgiven me for my infractions over the years. Indeed, the memories of times when Lillian has guided and supported me and so many others far outweigh all other times.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >A few days ago, Senator Pate and I were recalling when, soon after we arrived here as newbie senators, we rushed away from a prison visit that had been convened by the Senate Human Rights Committee, chaired then by Senator Munson, and we sped by train back to Ottawa for a meeting of the Aboriginal Peoples Committee, known widely just as APPA, chaired by Senator Dyck. En route, we managed to contact by phone Indigenous women‚Äôs rights advocates, including lawyer Sharon McIvor, who has been litigating against the Indian Act for decades, to hear their critique of what was then Bill¬†S-3, with a title that promised the ‚Äúelimination of sex-based inequities in registration‚Äù in the Indian Act. That was on the APPA agenda that evening. With some scribbled notes in hand, Kim and I rushed into the APPA committee meeting late; very late. Our colleagues had already begun the process that, frankly, at that time seemed mysterious to me of reviewing Bill¬†S-3 and deciding if any amendments could win majority approval. It seemed like only seconds after sitting down that APPA reached the crucial clause¬†that most concerned the Indigenous women leaders to whom we had been speaking with while we were on the train, and I blurted out an amendment based on those scribbled notes on the train napkin. </p>
 <p >(2040)</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >If Senator Dyck had not been in the chair that evening, I doubt that what became substantial amendments to Bill¬†S-3, and eventually Canadian law, would exist. That is because Senator Dyck chose to use her authority not to mock or undermine the sincere but inexperienced efforts of two rookie senators bringing to the table an amendment guided by the expertise of advocates for Indigenous women‚Äôs rights. Instead, she quietly and efficiently employed resources available to her as the committee chair to guide us to the point where the amendments were accepted by a majority of the APPA members, launching the process that would roll out for almost two more years, until August¬†15, 2019, when the amendments came into force. Dr.¬†Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, said on that day:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >I stand in solidarity with the Indigenous women who have been working so hard for decades to end sex-based discrimination in the Indian Act registration and am proud that today all remaining gender discrimination has been eliminated from Indian Act registration provisions.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Time is limited, but I am honoured to use this opportunity to share with you the voices of some Indigenous leaders who wish to convey their appreciation on the record here in the Senate.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >From the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action comes these words: </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >Thank you Senator Dyck for your crucial, steadfast and visionary support for the ‚Äô6(1)(a) all the way‚Äô amendment to the Indian Act, which finally came into force on August¬†15, 2019. Your leadership helped to bring an end to 150 years of sex discrimination against First Nations women, and to make thousands of First Nations women and their descendants eligible for ‚ÄôIndian‚Äô status for the first time. FAFIA was honoured to name you one of the Famous Six, along with Jeannette Corbiere Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, Sandra Lovelace-Nicholas, Sharon McIvor and Dr.¬†Lynn Gehl¬†‚Äî the six who have all been leaders in the long struggle to make First Nations women equal persons under the law. Lillian, we at FAFIA thank you for being a leader, a partner in history-making work, and a friend. We have learned from you and we hope to carry your clarity, your principle and your grit forward.

 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >We would like to acknowledge the years of leadership and perseverance of Senator Lillian Dyck as she served on the Senate of Canada. In her role she has worked tirelessly to address the crisis that is Missing and Murdered and Indigenous Women and Girls and to advance equity in the employment and education of women, Chinese Canadians and Indigenous peoples. She firmly established herself as a champion for Indigenous women‚Äôs rights, standing up to move Bill¬†S-3 and redress discrimination that robbed Indigenous women of their status and identity. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >The Union of BC Indian Chiefs would like to recognize Senator Dyck for all of the work she has done on behalf of all Indigenous people in Canada. She is a role model whose strength, compassion and wisdom many will aspire to emulate for years to come.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, when I arrived in Saskatoon over 13 years ago to join the faculty of the University of Saskatchewan College of Law led by then Dean Brent Cotter, Lillian and I had a friend in common, Senator Nancy Ruth. We reconnected quickly and she brought me into a remarkable Saskatoon group led by Indigenous women that welcomed all women who wanted to take action together, aptly entitled Iskwewuk E-wichiwitochik, or Women Walking Together, a grassroots network of activists established in 2005 to raise awareness about the human rights crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, and to provide moral and direct support to their family members. Each year, Iskwewuk organizes a Sisters In Spirit vigil on October¬†4. As Senator Cordy told us, this was the date when, at Lillian‚Äôs suggestion, the Senate stood in silent commemoration. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >In her tribute, Senator Bovey mentioned the special evening when, with Senator Pate, we attended the premiere at the National Arts Centre of <i>Caf√© Daughter</i> by Aboriginal playwright Kenneth Williams. Lillian told us after that brilliant and moving performance that it was true to her early years, and I have left the NAC that evening having new information about Lillian and being even more impressed. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >On August¬†15, when the Bill¬†S-3 amendments were fully activated, I was in Batoche standing on the banks of the South Saskatchewan River taking part in what has become a treasured memory of being with Senator Lillian Dyck and Senator Lovelace Nicholas. We stood on a path over 600 feet long that wound down to the banks of the river where our mutual friend Maria Campbell was leading the final ceremony for Walking With Our Sisters, the art exhibit that grew over the years into an ever-expanding travelling memorial for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls with over 2,000 handmade ‚Äúvamps‚Äù¬†‚Äî or moccasin tops¬†‚Äî all unfinished, purposely not sown into moccasins. As the creator and curator of the exhibit Christi Belcourt explained: </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" > The unfinished vamps represent a life cut short, and are as much a testament to those lost as they are to the love of the family members they left behind.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >As I conclude, I need to mention another admirable characteristic of Senator Dyck¬†‚Äî generosity of spirit. This evening, I‚Äôm wearing my favourite carved bone eagle earrings that some may recognize because I wear them often, especially on occasions when I need a little extra inspiration. Years before I arrived in this place, Lillian brought them on one of her trips to Winnipeg, and in gifting them explained that they were the creation of the famous carver Miles Henderson from Gordon First Nation, her home reserve.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Lillian, we‚Äôve spoken about how strange these last months have been in marking the end of your tenure here in the Senate, and we wish you were sitting here with us as we try to convey how much you mean to us and how much your presence strengthened this place. I miss you. We miss you. I have a feeling that you‚Äôre watching as we speak about you and to you. Please know your leadership has left a gap here, but we will do our very best to honour your strength, integrity and courage and be better senators for it. Thank you, Lillian.<i> Chi meegwetch</i>, dear Lillian.</p>

 </blockquote>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >On the Order:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >Resuming debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Cordy, calling the attention of the Senate to the career of the former senator the Honourable Lillian Eva Dyck.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Jim Munson: </b>Honourable senators, when I look around this chamber and see other senators virtually participating in this inquiry about Lillian Dyck, and seeing your accomplishments in what you have done in your professional and personal lives: How many of us have had themselves portrayed in a play? Imagine the story of your life on a stage. This is a story of Lillian Eva Dyck.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >It was the summer of 2017 when many of us rushed off to the National Arts Centre to see <i>Caf√© Daughter</i>. We were excited because this was the story of our colleague, Senator Dyck, the storyline of a bright student working up in a small Saskatchewan town. It was the 1950s, and the landscape in this prairie environment, like the landscape in all parts of the country, was one of racism and it wasn‚Äôt hidden. For the daughter of a Chinese father and a Cree mother, barriers were everywhere. Her mother asked her to hide her Cree heritage. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, I was moved by the play, and it reminded me of growing up in Campbellton, New Brunswick in the 1950s. My new friend was Kit Wong; he had just arrived from Hong Kong. His uncle owned the Glory Caf√©. Across the river was the Indian reserve. I have memories as a child of Kit and Indigenous young children facing community bullies.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Lillian‚Äôs dad owned the Victory Caf√©, like Kit in my hometown. She was very bright and it was her strength of intellect and personality which broke down barrier after barrier.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >She became connected to her Cree heritage, and that was transformative. Instead of being shameful to be, as she said, an Indian, she found another level of strength. Here is what she said:</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in;" >In fact, I have to laugh when I think of what a residential school survivor told me, who was a real character, and said you have to learn to man up. Stand your ground and not let it defeat you.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Well, as history has shown, the neuroscientist Dr.¬†Lillian Dyck has more than manned up. As the song goes, she did it her way. Lillian Dyck has fought the good fight. Her voice at every level has been heard, from the university, to the Senate, to the Highway of Tears which is Highway 16 in British Columbia, where many Indigenous women were murdered.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >By the way, the <i>Highway of Tears</i>, honourable senators, is a recent book by author Jessica McDiarmid. It‚Äôs a must read. I recommend it.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Here in the Senate, we have witnessed Lillian‚Äôs leadership, her passion and compassion. I sit behind her. I always had a box of Kleenex. I knew when she would be overcome by emotion. The issues she dealt with were personal. When someone hurt, she hurt. But she had a lighter side, and I liked to make her laugh. That‚Äôs the Lillian Dyck I will remember. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Shortly after she retired, we had a telephone chat. For one day she said she missed this place and even watched the proceedings. But the next day she returned to her favourite place. Somewhere out in the prairie she is bird watching, and she is watching whooping cranes. She was excited to tell me about her secret hiding place, a place where you can find peace of mind and a piece of time to reflect on where you have been and where you are.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senator Lillian Dyck has always lived in the moment. In her words, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt just live for yourself. You live for those around you.‚Äù</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Thank you, Lillian, for spending time on your life‚Äôs journey with us. The Senate is better for it, the country is better for it, your province is better for it. As a Caf√© Daughter, you have served and served well. Thank you.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Hon. Wanda Elaine Thomas Bernard: </b>Honourable senators, I‚Äôm honoured to share my voice today. I want to speak today on behalf of all Canadians, particularly women in general, and especially racialized women, to thank the Honourable Lillian Dyck, who retired from the Senate this past summer. I think it‚Äôs fitting that we are doing this today, International Human Rights Day, and also the last day of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Senator Dyck, on behalf of women in Canada, we thank her for being a trailblazer. We thank her for being a tireless advocate. We thank her for her demonstration of grace and tenacity during the most challenging situations. We thank her for being a strong role model and mentor for young women leaders.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >When I reflect on her life‚Äôs journey and all the contributions that she has made¬†‚Äî and many colleagues have spoken about those wonderful contributions¬†‚Äî I personally stand in awe, and I am truly grateful for the work she has done to break through so many barriers. She is truly a trailblazer: a woman of distinction in science, a woman of distinction in academia, a woman of distinction in her communities, and a woman of distinction here in the Senate. She has fearlessly advocated for the rights of those who do not have a voice.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >My only regret is that I did not get an opportunity to work closely with Senator Dyck prior to her retirement. However, I do hope to create some opportunities to work together in the future.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >Honourable senators, I wish our colleague Senator Dr.¬†Dyck the very best in her retirement and truly look forward to seeing what she does in her next chapter. Thank you.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>The Hon. the Speaker: </b>Honourable senators, there are five more senators on the list to speak this evening, and I know as well that Senator Dalphond is prepared to move the adjournment. We only have a little over a minute left. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to call upon another senator and interrupt them less than a minute into their speech. </p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >If the Senate is in agreement, I will call upon Senator Dalphond to adjourn, and when we return, the rest of the people who wish to speak will have their 15 minutes, because this is an inquiry, not Senators‚Äô Statements. Is it agreed, honourable senators?</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" ><b>Some Hon. Senators: </b>Agreed.</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >(On motion of Senator Dalphond, debate adjourned.)</p>
 <p style="margin-top:3mm;margin-right:0mm;margin-bottom:0mm;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;" >(<i>At 9¬†p.m., pursuant to the </i><i>order adopted by the Senate on October¬†27, 2020</i><i>, the Senate adjourned until </i><i>Monday, December¬†14, 2020, at 6¬†p.m.</i>)</p>
