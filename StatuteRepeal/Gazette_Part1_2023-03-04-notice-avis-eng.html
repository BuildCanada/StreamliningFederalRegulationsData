    <h4><cite>Guidelines for Canadian drinking water quality&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Boron</cite></h4>
    <p>Pursuant to subsection&nbsp;55(3) of the&nbsp;<cite>Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999</cite>, the Minister of Health hereby gives notice of the final guidelines for Canadian drinking water quality for boron. The technical document for these guidelines is available on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/reports-publications/water-quality.html">Water Quality website</a>. This document was publicly consulted for 60&nbsp;days in 2020 and was updated taking into consideration the comments received.</p>
    <p>March&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2023</p>
    <p><strong>Greg Carreau</strong> <br>
        Director General<br>
        Safe Environments Directorate<br>
        On behalf of the Minister of Health</p>
    <h3>ANNEX</h3>
    <h4>Guideline</h4>
    <p>A maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) of 5&nbsp;mg/L (5&nbsp;000&nbsp;&mu;g/L) is established for total boron in drinking water based on treatment achievability.</p>
    <h5>Executive summary</h5>
    <p>This guideline technical document was prepared in collaboration with the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Committee on Drinking Water (CDW) and assesses all available information on boron.</p>
    <h5>Exposure</h5>
    <p>Boron enters the environment from natural sources, such as seawater spray and the weathering of rocks and soils, as well as from human activities, such as fossil fuel combustion and municipal and industrial wastewater discharge. Boron is also found in pesticides; cosmetics; pharmaceuticals; natural health products; many consumer products, such as swimming pool and spa products; and cleaning products. In water, boron exists primarily as boric acid and borate.</p>
    <p>The main source for Canadians‚Äô exposure to boron is food, although consumer products can also contribute significantly to exposure. Exposure through drinking water can contribute up to 16% of total dietary boron exposure. In most Canadian drinking water supplies, boron is below 0.1&nbsp;mg/L. Higher concentrations of boron (1&ndash;8&nbsp;mg/L) can be found in certain areas of Canada, particularly in groundwater supplies in areas with naturally occurring boron. However, elevated concentrations of boron are likely to occur only in a limited number of drinking water systems in Canada. Intake of boron from drinking water through skin contact or inhalation during showering or bathing is expected to be negligible.</p>
    <h5>Health effects</h5>
    <p>Boron is not an essential element, but some studies indicate it may be beneficial to human health. Studies in humans have found possible associations between boron and effects on reproduction and development. However, these studies have a number of design limitations and cannot be used for risk assessment. Adverse effects to the male reproductive system following ingestion of high levels of boron have consistently been observed during studies in animals. This conclusion supports effects seen in human studies. Testicular effects observed in dogs were the most sensitive endpoint and are used to establish the health-based value (HBV) of 0.1&nbsp;mg/L. The HBV is derived using a conservative approach, intended to be protective against potential reproductive effects.</p>
    <h5>Treatment and analytical considerations</h5>
    <p>The guideline development process considers the ability to both measure (quantify) and remove (treat) a contaminant in drinking water. There are several methods available for the analysis of total boron in drinking water at concentrations well below the HBV. Therefore, the ability to measure boron is not a limitation in the establishment of a MAC. Measurement should be of total boron, which includes both the dissolved and particulate forms of boron in a water sample.</p>
    <p>Treatment technologies that are available to remove boron from drinking water supplies include reverse osmosis (RO) and ion exchange (IX). However, data from municipal-scale treatment plants indicate that a treated water concentration of 0.1&nbsp;mg/L is not achievable for most systems. Assessment of the data indicates that a treated water concentration of less than 5&nbsp;mg/L is achievable using RO or IX (with boron selective resin [BSR]) treatment systems of varying complexity that are designed and operated for boron removal. This achievability offers drinking water treatment providers flexibility in the type of RO or IX processes that can be used to achieve the MAC, including systems with higher boron concentrations (&ge; 5&nbsp;mg/L) in their source water. A concentration of 5&nbsp;mg/L in treated water is also achievable for small drinking water systems using less complex technologies (single-pass RO system designed for boron removal) that may be more practical where resources are limited.</p>
    <p>Although options for residential-scale treatment technologies that are effective for the removal of boron are limited, RO and distillation treatment units are expected to be capable of removing boron to 5&nbsp;mg/L or less in treated water.</p>
    <p>Since treatment technology achievability is a limiting factor in establishing a guideline for boron in drinking water, Health Canada and the CDW will continue to monitor new developments in treatment technologies to revise and update the guideline and the guideline technical document as required.</p>
    <h5>Distribution system</h5>
    <p>Where boron is present in source water, utilities should determine if boron must be included in their distribution system management plan. Although information on the presence of boron in distribution systems has not been reported in the literature, utilities that have aluminum or iron oxide deposits in the distribution system may need to confirm that the accumulation and release of boron (along with other metals such as manganese, arsenic and uranium) is not occurring.</p>
    <h5>Application of the guideline</h5>
    <p>Note: Specific guidance related to the implementation of drinking water guidelines should be obtained from the appropriate drinking water authority.</p>
    <p>All water utilities should implement a risk management approach, such as the source-to-tap or water safety plan approach, to ensure water safety. These approaches require a system assessment to characterize the source water and describe the existing barriers that prevent or reduce contamination. The appropriate control measures an operational monitoring are then established, and operational/management protocols are instituted (e.g. standard operating procedures, corrective actions and incident responses). Compliance monitoring is determined and other protocols to validate the water safety plan are implemented (e.g. record keeping, consumer satisfaction). Operator training is also required to ensure the effectiveness of the water safety plan at all times.</p>
    <p>The HBV is derived using a conservative approach, intended to be protective against potential reproductive effects. The guideline is risk managed to take into consideration the treatment challenges of achieving a lower MAC than that proposed, in particular the limited resources and options available to small drinking water systems and private well owners.</p>
    <p>Efforts should be made to reduce boron in drinking water to levels lower than 5&nbsp;mg/L where possible. Lower concentrations can be achieved by some drinking water treatment systems depending on the source water quality, the type of treatment technology in place and the operational conditions of the treatment plant.</p>
    <p>An exceedance of the MAC should be investigated and followed by the appropriate corrective actions, if required. For exceedances in source water where there is no treatment in place, additional monitoring to confirm the exceedance should be conducted. If it is confirmed that source water boron concentrations are above the MAC, then an investigation to determine the most appropriate way to reduce exposure to boron should be conducted. Measures may include use of an alternate water supply or installation of treatment. Where treatment is already in place and an exceedance occurs, an investigation should be conducted to verify treatment and determine if adjustments are needed to lower the treated water concentration below the MAC.</p>

    <h3><cite>Public release of the initial environmental assessment for the modernization of the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement</cite></h3>
    <p>In accordance with the <cite><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environmental-assessment-agency/programs/strategic-environmental-assessment/cabinet-directive-environmental-assessment-policy-plan-program-proposals.html">Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals</a></cite>, Global Affairs Canada is committed to conducting environmental assessments for all trade and investment negotiations using a process that requires interdepartmental coordination and public consultation. The objectives of the environmental assessment of a trade agreement are</p>
    <ul class="lst-spcd mrgn-lft-lg list-unstyled">
        <li>(1) to assist Canadian negotiators to integrate environmental considerations into the negotiating process by providing information on the environmental impacts of a proposed trade agreement; and</li>
        <li>(2) to document how environmental factors are being considered in the course of trade negotiations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Government of Canada is committed to sustainable development. Mutually supportive trade and environmental policies can contribute to this objective. To this end, the Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development has directed trade officials to seek information and otherwise improve their understanding of the relationship between trade and environmental issues at the earliest stages of decision-making, and to do this through an open and inclusive process. Environmental assessments of trade negotiations are critical to this work.</p>
    <p>The Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA) entered into force in August&nbsp;2017. While it is a comprehensive agreement from a trade-in-goods perspective, it does not contain chapters on services and investment. Under the terms of CUFTA, Canada and Ukraine committed to reviewing the Agreement within two years of its entry into force, with a view to expanding it. In July&nbsp;2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that both Parties had agreed to move forward with modernization. The Government of Canada undertook public consultations in February and in March&nbsp;2020, and a mandate to proceed with modernization was approved by the Cabinet in November&nbsp;2020. On March&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2021, the Government of Canada published the <a href="/rp-pr/p1/2021/2021-03-20/html/notice-avis-eng.html#ne2">Notice of intent to conduct impact assessments of the modernization of the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement</a>. Following delays due to COVID-19, Minister Mary Ng and Ukraine‚Äôs First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy, Yulia Svyrydenko, launched CUFTA modernization negotiations on January&nbsp;27,&nbsp;2022. While progress was subsequently paused as a result of the Russian invasion on February&nbsp;24, ministers agreed to resume and expedite modernization in May&nbsp;2022. In addition to adding services and investment, the Parties are seeking to expand the Agreement to include new chapters and provisions on inclusive trade, labour and environment, among others.</p>
    <p>On March&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2023, the Government of Canada published the <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ukraine/iea-eep.aspx?lang=eng">Initial Environmental Assessment for CUFTA Modernization</a>. All interested parties are invited to submit their comments on the initial environmental assessment by April&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2023.</p>
    <p>Prior to ratification of the final modernized free trade agreement (FTA), a final environmental assessment will be undertaken to assess the potential impacts of the negotiated outcome on the environment in Canada and beyond.</p>
    <p>The Government of Canada is seeking the views of underrepresented groups in trade, such as women, Indigenous peoples, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as industry stakeholders, non-governmental organizations, and all interested Canadian citizens.</p>

    <h3><cite>Summary of the initial gender-based analysis plus on the modernization of the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement negotiations</cite></h3>
    <p>In July&nbsp;2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a commitment to expand and modernize the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA). <a href="/rp-pr/p1/2020/2020-02-15/html/notice-avis-eng.html#ne9">Public consultations on the potential modernization of CUFTA</a> were held from February&nbsp;15 to March&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2020, followed by a <a href="/rp-pr/p1/2021/2021-03-20/html/notice-avis-eng.html#ne2">notice of intent</a> to conduct impact assessments, including a gender-based analysis plus (GBA+), in March&nbsp;2021.</p>
    <p>On January&nbsp;27,&nbsp;2022, Canada‚Äôs Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, Mary Ng, and Ukraine‚Äôs First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy, Yulia Svyrydenko, officially launched negotiations towards the <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ukraine/cufta_modernization-modernisation_alecu.aspx?lang=eng">modernization of CUFTA</a>. The Government of Canada is committed to the advancement of an inclusive approach to trade. This approach seeks to ensure that the benefits and opportunities resulting from FTAs are more widely shared, including among underrepresented groups in Canada‚Äôs economy and trade, such as women, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and Indigenous peoples. In this regard, the government has committed to conduct a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative chapter-by-chapter GBA+ process to inform CUFTA modernization negotiations through an examination of gender and other diversity considerations. The GBA+ aims to provide a better understanding of the potential effects and opportunities of a modernized CUFTA on all people in Canada&mdash;workers, producers, business owners, entrepreneurs, and, where possible, consumers. In this regard, the GBA+ will also help Canadian officials in negotiations with Ukraine identify opportunities for Canada to pursue new gender-responsive and inclusive trade provisions.

    <p>On March&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2023, Canada released a <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ukraine/summary_gba-acs_sommaire.aspx?lang=eng">summary of the&nbsp;initial GBA+ report</a>&nbsp;conducted on the modernization negotiations of CUFTA. This summary is being published in order to seek stakeholder feedback on the potential differentiated effects of a modernized CUFTA on men and women in Canada, and on any other gender diverse people, with SMEs and Indigenous peoples as priority considerations.</p>
    <p>Global Affairs Canada welcomes stakeholder feedback on this summary of the initial GBA+ report. The deadline for submission is April&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2023.<br>

    <p><cite>We know that our country is stronger&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and our government more effective&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;when decision-makers reflect Canada‚Äôs diversity. The Government of Canada has implemented an appointment process that is transparent and merit-based, strives for gender parity, and ensures that Indigenous peoples and minority groups are properly represented in positions of leadership. We continue to search for Canadians who reflect the values that we all embrace: inclusion, honesty, fiscal prudence, and generosity of spirit. Together, we will build a government as diverse as Canada</cite>.</p>
    <p><cite>We are equally committed to providing a healthy workplace that supports one‚Äôs dignity, self-esteem and the ability to work to one‚Äôs full potential. With this in mind, all appointees will be expected to take steps to promote and maintain a healthy, respectful and harassment-free work environment</cite>.</p>
    <p><cite>The Government of Canada is currently seeking applications from diverse and talented Canadians from across the country who are interested in the following positions</cite>.</p>
