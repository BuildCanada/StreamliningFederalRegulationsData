  <h3><cite>Notice to interested parties&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Electronic shipping document study for dangerous goods shipments</cite></h3>
  <p>This notice is to inform stakeholders that Transport Canada (TC) has launched a <a href="https://www.tc.gc.ca/en/services/dangerous-goods/regulatory-sandbox-electronic-shipping-documents.html">regulatory sandbox project on electronic shipping documents</a>. The intent of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of permitting electronic shipping documents (e-shipping documents) as an alternative to physical paper shipping documents in the <cite>Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations</cite> (TDGR).</p>
  <h4>What is a regulatory sandbox?</h4>
  <p>The term &ldquo;regulatory sandbox&rdquo; refers to testing grounds for new business models. It allows firms to test innovative products, services, and business models in a live market environment, while ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place.<sup id="footnoteRef.52272"> <a class="fn-lnk" href="#footnote.52272"><span class="wb-inv">footnote </span>1</a></sup></p>
  <h4>Drivers for change</h4>
  <p>As the transportation sector continues to evolve in line with technological advancements, TC is undertaking a concerted effort to modernize the framework of the TDGR. This transformation process will increase Canada&rsquo;s competitiveness and foster innovation, while maintaining the safety of Canadians.</p>
  <p>Part&nbsp;3, Documentation, of the TDGR currently stipulates that a physical paper shipping document must accompany most dangerous goods during transit. Shipping documents provide a summary of the dangerous goods being transported and provide first responders with essential information to develop a response plan during an incident.</p>
  <p>Potential benefits of using e-shipping documents may include the following:</p>
  <ul class="lst-spcd">
    <li>Improved legibility and accuracy of information related to shipments;</li>
    <li>A simplified process for updating information on the shipping document;</li>
    <li>Quicker sharing of information with emergency responders during an incident;</li>
    <li>Integration of shipping documents with other fully digital business processes;</li>
    <li>Alignment with international regulations, such as the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code) and the International Civil Aviation Organization&rsquo;s (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air, which currently accept electronic transport documents for international shipments; and</li>
    <li>Greater flexibility and the opportunity to give Canadian businesses a competitive edge.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Goals, scope, and intent of project</h4>
  <p>The goal of the regulatory sandbox is to evaluate whether an equivalent or greater level of safety can be achieved with e-shipping documents and if so, determine the appropriate conditions. This project is not a regulatory amendment, nor a regulatory proposal. It is a thorough analysis of potential impacts on Canadians, including the associated benefits, costs, and performance of e-shipping documents.</p>
  <p>The use of e-shipping documents from point of origin to final destination in different modes (road, rail, air, marine) will be evaluated from multiple perspectives with a focus on emergency response. This project will also consider rural and urban environments, including areas with limited or no Internet or cellular coverage.</p>
  <p>TC will not be removing paper shipping documents, nor is there an intent to create a central database or online system of shipping documents. The aim of this initiative is to assess the viability of e-shipping documents as an option for companies.</p>
  <p>No specific technology or system will be imposed in this project, as TC is interested in evaluating a variety of platforms and technologies.</p>
  <h4>Project overview</h4>
  <p>Key aspects of TC&rsquo;s strategy to evaluate the performance, impacts, costs, and benefits of e-shipping documents include the following:</p>
  <ul class="lst-spcd">
    <li>Issuing equivalency certificates that will allow the use of e-shipping documents instead of paper shipping documents to selected businesses which meet specific safety requirements. Authorization will only be granted for the duration of the project (2020 to spring 2022), which will allow TC to assess the performance of e-shipping documents.</li>
    <li>A series of exercises designed to test the effectiveness of e-shipping documents in emergency response situations. These simulations will focus on communicating shipping document information.</li>
    <li>Ongoing engagement with stakeholders, including emergency response personnel, industry representatives, law enforcement personnel, and TC&rsquo;s provincial, territorial, and regional counterparts, through a combination of focus groups, interviews, questionnaires, working groups, and various social media platforms, to keep TC apprised of potential issues and benefits associated with e-shipping documents.</li>
    <li>Engaging with international partners such as the United States Department of Transport to determine how e-shipping documents can be used for cross-border transportation and better understand practices in countries where e-shipping documents are permitted.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Upon completion of the regulatory sandbox, TC will publish a final report on the feasibility and effectiveness of e-shipping documents, including recommendations on the use of e-shipping documents in the TDGR.</p>

  <h3><cite>Consulting Canadians on possible negotiations to modernize the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement</cite></h3>
  <p>The Government of Canada is committed to diversifying trade and investment with key markets around the world and to strengthening Canada&rsquo;s ties with existing free trade agreement partners. Global Affairs Canada is seeking input from Canadians on possible modernization negotiations of the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement&nbsp;(CUFTA).</p>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>Canada and Ukraine have enjoyed close bilateral relations since Canada became the first Western nation to recognize Ukraine&rsquo;s independence on December&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1991. The bilateral relationship is further reinforced by strong people-to-people ties between our two countries, with almost 1.4&nbsp;million Canadians of Ukrainian heritage. CUFTA, which entered into force on August&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017, represents an important milestone in the Canada&ndash;Ukraine bilateral relationship. In addition to generating commercial benefits for Canadian businesses, CUFTA supports the economic reform efforts of the Government of Ukraine, and helps pave the way for long-term security, stability, and broad-based economic development in Ukraine.</p>
  <p>Since CUFTA&rsquo;s entry into force, two-way merchandise trade has grown, reaching $346&nbsp;million in 2018. Canada&rsquo;s merchandise exports to Ukraine were $220&nbsp;million, and merchandise imports from Ukraine were $126&nbsp;million. Canada&rsquo;s top four exports to Ukraine were mineral and fuel oils ($87.3&nbsp;million), fish and seafood ($51.2&nbsp;million), machinery ($19.9&nbsp;million), and pharmaceuticals ($13.9&nbsp;million). Canada&rsquo;s top imports from Ukraine were iron and steel ($30.3&nbsp;million), electronic equipment ($18.4&nbsp;million), paints, dyes and tanning products ($11.9&nbsp;million), and machinery ($10.4&nbsp;million). The stock of Canadian direct investment in Ukraine stood at $685&nbsp;million at the end of&nbsp;2018.</p>
  <p>CUFTA includes chapters in the areas of market access for goods; rules of origin and origin procedures; trade facilitation; emergency action and trade remedies; sanitary and phytosanitary measures; technical barriers to trade; government procurement; competition policy, monopolies and state enterprises; intellectual property; electronic commerce; labour; environment; transparency; trade-related cooperation; institutional provisions; and dispute settlement.</p>
  <p>In July&nbsp;2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a mutual commitment to expand and modernize CUFTA. A modernization of the Agreement provides an opportunity to increase the Agreement&rsquo;s benefits for Canadians by further diversifying and expanding Canada&rsquo;s preferential access to Ukraine, and advancing an inclusive approach to trade so that the benefits of trade are widely shared. A modernization of CUFTA would also help reinforce the rules-based international system and promote the development of global value chains, strengthening Canada&rsquo;s connectivity to the region.</p>
  <p>CUFTA contains a review clause (Article&nbsp;19.2) that commits the Parties to review the Agreement within two years of its entry into force &ldquo;with a view to examining the further development and deepening of its provisions, and to extending it to subject matters not covered [by the Agreement].&rdquo; The review clause specifically identifies cross-border trade in services (CBTS), financial services, investment, telecommunications, and temporary entry, but does not restrict the Parties to exploring other potential areas.</p>
  <h5>Submissions by interested parties</h5>
  <p>Interested parties are invited to submit their views on a potential modernization of CUFTA, including specific interests, priorities, and potential sensitivities. The following are examples of areas where the Government of Canada would appreciate receiving views from Canadians:</p>
  <ul class="lst-spcd">
    <li><strong>Investment barriers</strong>, including restrictions imposed on foreign ownership or entry to market, questions of transparency of regulation and performance requirements;</li>
    <li><strong>Interests related to trade in services</strong>, specifically identification of sectors and activities of export interest for Canadian service providers, market access barriers and domestic regulatory measures that either restrict or affect the ability to conduct business or deliver services in Ukraine; and whether the ability to conduct trade in services would be improved through the transparent listing of domestic regulatory measures that limit market access;</li>
    <li><strong>Temporary entry of business people from Canada into Ukraine and from Ukraine into Canada</strong> (e.g. any impediments when seeking to move key personnel between Ukraine and Canada on a temporary basis to set up an investment, to work or to fulfill a contract, or to participate in business meetings);</li>
    <li><strong>Electronic commerce</strong> (e.g. any restrictive measures faced by Canadian suppliers of digital products and services in Ukraine, such as requirements for data localization);</li>
    <li><strong>Inclusive trade elements</strong>, notably more robust and strengthened environment and labour obligations, but also broader inclusive trade priorities such as those related to small and medium-sized enterprises, trade and gender, and Indigenous peoples; and</li>
    <li>Any other trade-related topics of interest or potential concern to Canadians.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please be advised that any information received as a result of this consultation will be considered as public information unless explicitly requested otherwise. The deadline for submission is Monday, March&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2020. Submissions should include the following:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled lst-spcd">
    <li>1.	The contributor&rsquo;s name and address, and, if applicable, the name of the contributor&rsquo;s organization, institution or business;</li>
    <li>2.	The specific issues being addressed; and</li>
    <li>3.	Where possible, precise information on the rationale for the position taken, including any significant impact it may have on Canada&rsquo;s domestic or international interests.</li>
