    <p class="indent-1-0">The purpose of this notice is to announce two decisions related to conditions of licence. First, it announces Industry Canada's decision to modify a condition of licence requiring licensees to invest a portion of their adjusted gross revenues in research and development (R&amp;D) activities.

The resultant decision paper stated that Industry Canada's decision with regard to the R&amp;D condition of licence would be the subject of a separate paper to be issued at a later date. As a result of this decision, Industry Canada will update GL-03 &mdash; <cite>Guidelines for Compliance with the Radio Authorization Condition of Licence Relating to Research and Development</cite>.</p>
    <p class="indent-1-0">This notice also announces Industry Canada's decision to replace a condition of licence requiring certain licensees in the 2500 MHz band to invest in a Learning Plan with the requirement that they invest a portion of their adjusted gross revenues in R&amp;D activities.

        Location: Ottawa, Ontario</p>
    <p class="indent-1-0">The Royal Canadian Mint (the Mint) was originally established in 1908 as a branch of the Royal Mint of London, England.

On April 1, 1969, with the passage of the <cite>Royal Canadian Mint Act</cite>, the Mint became a Crown corporation and now reports to Parliament through the Minister of Finance.</p>
    <p class="indent-1-0">Today, the Mint is a commercial enterprise whose business ventures extend throughout the world. The Mint is classified as a Schedule III-II Corporation under the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>, the category reserved for organizations that conduct commercial operations and are self-sufficient. The Mint owns two facilities. The Ottawa facility houses the corporate head office, the gold and silver refineries and production facilities for non-circulation coins and medals. The Winnipeg plant, which includes a plating facility, produces all of Canada's circulation coins as well as circulation coins for numerous foreign countries.

    </ul>
    <p class="indent-1-0">As the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, the Master of the Mint reports to the Board of Directors and is responsible for providing leadership and direction in all aspects of the Corporation's activities, business performance and strategic development.

    <p class="indent-1-0">The ideal candidate would have the ability to appreciate the needs of diverse stakeholders, develop and articulate a corporate vision, and convert this into a strategic action plan. The ability to lead with strategic agility while inspiring a high performance workforce and building an entrepreneurial culture of teamwork and customer-focus is sought, as is the ability to establish and maintain strong and effective relationships with businesses, government and external stakeholders domestically and abroad.
