    <p >The Instructions are consistent with IRPA objectives as laid out in section&nbsp;3, specifically to pursue the maximum social, cultural and economic benefits of immigration; to enrich and strengthen the social and cultural fabric of Canadian society; to support the development of a strong and prosperous Canadian economy; and to protect public health and safety and to maintain the security of Canadian society.</p>

    <h4>Instructions for processing Atlantic Intermediate Canada Skilled Worker Class, Atlantic Canada Highly Skilled Worker Class and Atlantic Canada International Graduate Class applications<br>
        </h4>
    <p >For an application to be considered a complete application under the Atlantic Canada Intermediate Skilled Worker Class, the Atlantic Canada Highly Skilled Worker Class and the Atlantic Canada International Graduate Class, it must meet the application kit requirements in place at the time the application is received by the Centralized Intake Office in Sydney, Nova Scotia.</p>

The overall objective of the Clean Fuel Standard is to achieve 30&nbsp;megatonnes of annual reductions in GHG&nbsp;emissions by&nbsp;2030, contributing to Canada's effort to achieve its overall GHG mitigation target of a 30%&nbsp;emission reduction below 2005&nbsp;levels by&nbsp;2030.</p>
    <p >The Clean Fuel Standard will be a modern, flexible, performance-based approach that would incent the use of a broad range of lower carbon fuels, alternative energy sources and technologies, such as electricity, hydrogen, and renewable fuels, including renewable natural gas. It would address a broad suite of fuels, including gaseous, solid and liquid fuels, and would go beyond transportation fuels to include those used in industry, homes and buildings. The approach would not differentiate between crude oil types produced in Canada and those imported into Canada.</p>
    <p >The purpose of the discussion paper is to facilitate consultations by seeking early views to help inform the development of the regulatory framework in advance of developing a Clean Fuel Standard.</p>

    <h3>EXPLANATORY NOTE </h3>
    <p>(<cite>This explanatory note is not part of the&nbsp;Significant New Activity Notice.</cite>)</p>
    <h4 class="headline">Description</h4>
    <p >A Significant New Activity Notice is a legal instrument adopted by the Minister of the Environment pursuant to section&nbsp;85 of the <cite>Canadian Environmental Protection&nbsp;Act,&nbsp;1999</cite> (CEPA) to apply the Significant New Activity (SNAc) provisions of that Act to 2-propanol, 1-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-, Chemical Abstracts Service Registry No.&nbsp;6712-98-7. The Notice is now in force. It is therefore mandatory to meet all the requirements of the Notice should a person intend to use the substance for a significant new activity as defined in the Notice. <a href="#footnote.53283" id="footnoteRef.53283">(see footnote 3)</a></p>
    <p >A Significant New Activity Notice does not constitute an endorsement from the Department of the Environment or the Government of Canada of the substance to which it relates, or an exemption from any other laws or regulations that are in force in Canada and that may apply to this substance or activities involving the substance.</p>
    <h4 class="headline">Applicability of the Significant New Activity Notice </h4>
    <p >The Notice requires that any person (individual or corporation) engaging in a significant new activity in relation to 2-propanol, 1-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-, Chemical Abstracts Service Registry No.&nbsp;6712-98-7, submit a Significant New Activity Notification (SNAN) containing all of the information prescribed in the Notice at least 90&nbsp;days prior to using the substance for the significant new activity.</p>
    <p >In order to address human health concerns, the Notice targets the use of the substance in consumer products to which the <cite>Canada Consumer Product Safety Act</cite> (CCPSA) <a href="#footnote.53280" id="footnoteRef.53280">(see footnote 4)</a> applies, in natural health products as defined in subsection&nbsp;1(1) of the <cite>Natural Health Products Regulations</cite> <a href="#footnote.53277" id="footnoteRef.53277">(see footnote 5)</a> or any other drug as defined in the <cite>Food and Drugs Act</cite>, and in cosmetics as defined in section&nbsp;2 of the <cite>Food and Drugs Act</cite>. <a href="#footnote.53274" id="footnoteRef.53274">(see footnote 6)</a> A notification is required for the manufacture of such products with the substance.</p>
    <p >For any other activity related to any of these products, notification is required when, during a calendar year, the total quantity of the substance in the product is greater than 10&nbsp;kg. For example, notification is required if a person plans to use a consumer product (e.g. paint) where there is more than 10&nbsp;kg of the substance involved in a calendar year. Examples of products of concern include, but are not limited to, do-it-yourself products such as paints, coatings, adhesives, sealants, and epoxies. The substance is not known to be currently used in consumer products, in natural health products, in drugs or in cosmetics in Canada.</p>
    <h4 class="headline">Activities not subject to the Notice </h4>
    <p >Activities involving the use of the substance as a research and development substance, a site-limited intermediate or an export-only substance are excluded from the Notice. The terms &ldquo;research and development substance&rdquo; and &ldquo;site-limited intermediate substance&rdquo; are defined in subsection&nbsp;1(1) of the <cite>New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers)</cite>. <a href="#footnote.53603" id="footnoteRef.53603">(see footnote 7)</a> An export-only substance is a substance that is manufactured in or imported into Canada and destined solely for foreign markets.</p>
    <p >This Notice does not apply to products to which the CCPSA does not apply (see Annex A for the CCPSA definition of &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo; and exemptions), with the exception of natural health products within the meaning of subsection&nbsp;1(1) of the <cite>Natural Health Products Regulations</cite>, and other drugs and cosmetics within the meaning of section&nbsp;2 of the <cite>Food and Drugs Act. </cite>It also does not apply to uses of the substance that are regulated under the acts of Parliament listed in Schedule&nbsp;2 of CEPA, including the <cite>Pest Control Products Act</cite>, the <cite>Fertilizers Act</cite> and the <cite>Feeds Act</cite>. The Notice also does not apply to transient reaction intermediates, impurities, contaminants, partially unreacted materials, or in some circumstances to items such as, but not limited to, wastes, mixtures, or manufactured items. However, it should be noted that individual components of a mixture may be subject to notification under the SNAc provisions of CEPA. See subsection&nbsp;81(6) and section&nbsp;3 of CEPA, and section&nbsp;3 of the <cite>Guidelines for the Notification and Testing of New Substances: Chemicals and Polymers</cite> for additional information. <a href="#footnote.53598" id="footnoteRef.53598">(see footnote 8)</a></p>
    <h4 class="headline">Information to be submitted </h4>
    <p >The Notice sets out the information that must be provided to the Minister 90&nbsp;days before the day on which the substance 2-propanol, 1-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-, Chemical Abstracts Service Registry No.&nbsp;6712-98-7, is used for a significant new activity. The Department of the Environment and the Department of Health will use the information submitted in the SNAN to conduct human health and environmental assessments within 90&nbsp;days after the complete information is received.</p>
    <p >The assessment of the substance identified concerns associated with potential activities and human chronic exposure resulting in systemic and developmental toxicity to the consumer. The Significant New Activity Notice is issued to obtain information to ensure that the substance will undergo further assessment before significant new activities are undertaken.</p>
    <p >The information requirements in the Notice relate to general information in respect of the substance, details surrounding its use, exposure information, and developmental and reproductive toxicity data in respect of the substance. Some of the information requirements reference the <cite>New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers)</cite>. <a href="#footnote.53593" id="footnoteRef.53593">(see footnote 9)</a></p>
    <p >Additional guidance on preparing a SNAN can be found in section&nbsp;1.3 of the <cite>Guidelines for the Notification and Testing of New Substances: Chemicals and Polymers</cite>. <a href="#footnote.53591" id="footnoteRef.53591">(see footnote 10)</a></p>
    <h4 class="headline">Transitional provision </h4>
    <p >A transitional provision is included in the Notice to facilitate compliance by persons who may already have imported or manufactured up to 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg of the substance and started activities with it. The notice comes into force immediately. However, if the substance is used to manufacture any consumer products, natural health products, drugs or cosmetics, a threshold of 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg applies for the period between the publication of the Notice and March&nbsp;31, 2018. On April&nbsp;1, 2018, the threshold for this significant new activity will be lowered to 0&nbsp;kg per calendar year for the manufacture of the above-mentioned products and 10&nbsp;kg per calendar year for any other activity.</p>
    <h4 class="headline">Compliance</h4>
    <p >When assessing whether or not a substance is subject to SNAc provisions, <a href="#footnote.53588" id="footnoteRef.53588">(see footnote 11)</a> a person is expected to make use of information in their possession or to which they ought to have access. The phrase &ldquo;to which they ought to have access&rdquo; means information in any of the notifier's offices worldwide or other locations where the notifier can reasonably have access to the information. For example, manufacturers are expected to have access to their formulations, while importers or users of a substance, mixture, or product are expected to have access to import records, usage information and the relevant Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). <a href="#footnote.53586" id="footnoteRef.53586">(see footnote 12)</a></p>
    <p >Although an SDS is an important source of information on the composition of a purchased product, it should be noted that the goal of the SDS is to protect the health of workers in the workplace from specific hazards of chemical products. Therefore, an SDS may not list all product ingredients that may be subject to a SNAc notice due to human health or environmental concerns. Any person requiring more detailed information on product composition is encouraged to contact their supplier.</p>
    <p >If any information becomes available that reasonably supports the conclusion that the substance 2-propanol, 1-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-, Chemical Abstracts Service Registry No.&nbsp;6712-98-7, is toxic or capable of becoming toxic, the person who is in possession of the information and is involved in activities with the substance is obligated, under section&nbsp;70 of CEPA, to provide that information to the Minister without delay.</p>
    <p >A company can submit a SNAN on behalf of its clients. For example, in cases where a person takes possession or control of a substance from another person, they may not be required to submit a SNAN, under certain conditions, if their activities were covered by an original SNAN submitted by the person from whom they obtained the substance. The Substances Management Advisory Note &ldquo;Clarification in relation to the submission of Significant New Activity Notifications in application of the<cite> Canadian Environmental Protection Act,&nbsp;1999</cite>&rdquo; provides more detail on this subject. <a href="#footnote.53581" id="footnoteRef.53581">(see footnote 13)</a> </p>
    <p >Under section&nbsp;86 of CEPA, any person who transfers the physical possession or control of&nbsp;a substance subject to a SNAc notice shall notify all persons to whom the physical possession or control is transferred of the obligation to comply with the notice, including the obligation to notify the Minister of any significant new activity and to provide all the required information outlined above.</p>
    <p >A pre-notification consultation (PNC) is recommended for notifiers who wish to consult with the program during the planning or preparation of their SNAN to discuss any questions or concerns they have about the prescribed information and test plans.</p>
    <p >Where a person has questions concerning their obligations to comply with a notice, believes they may be out of compliance, or would like to request a PNC, they are encouraged to discuss their particular circumstances with the program by contacting the Substances Management Information Line. <a href="#footnote.53578" id="footnoteRef.53578">(see footnote 14)</a> </p>
    <p >CEPA is enforced in accordance with the publicly available Compliance and Enforcement Policy for the<cite> Canadian Environmental Protection Act,&nbsp;1999</cite>. <a href="#footnote.53573" id="footnoteRef.53573">(see footnote 15)</a> In instances of non-compliance, consideration is given to factors such as the nature of the alleged violation, potential harm, intent, and history of compliance.</p>
    <h3>ANNEX A</h3>
    <h4>Consumer product definition in the <cite>Canada Consumer Product Safety Act</cite> <a href="#footnote.53569" id="footnoteRef.53569">(see footnote 16)</a></h4>
    <p >In section&nbsp;2 of the <cite>Canada Consumer Product Safety Act </cite>(CCPSA), &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;&nbsp;means a product, including its components, parts or accessories, that may reasonably be expected to be obtained by an individual to be used for non-commercial purposes, including for domestic, recreational and sports purposes, and includes its packaging. Section&nbsp;4 of the CCPSA describes the application of the Act as follows:</p>

    <h4>Summary of the draft screening assessment of seven ethylene glycol ethers</h4>
    <p >Pursuant to section&nbsp;68 or&nbsp;74 of the <cite>Canadian Environmental Protection Act,&nbsp;1999&nbsp;</cite>(CEPA), the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Health have conducted a screening assessment of seven substances referred to herein as the Ethylene Glycol Ethers Group. The substances in this group were identified as priorities for assessment, as they met the categorization criteria under subsection&nbsp;73(1)&nbsp;of CEPA. The Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CAS RN <a href="#footnote.54153" id="footnoteRef.54153">(see footnote 17)</a>), the <cite>Domestic Substances List</cite>&nbsp;(DSL)&nbsp;names, the common names and acronyms of the substances are listed in the table below.</p>

    <p >Two other substances (the substances bearing CAS&nbsp;RNs&nbsp;111-96-6&nbsp;and&nbsp;112-49-2) were identified as being part of the Ethylene Glycol Ethers Group on the&nbsp;two-year rolling risk assessment publication plan published in May&nbsp;2016. These two substances were considered in the Ecological Risk Classification of organic substances and the Human Health Threshold of Toxicological Concern Science Approach and were identified as being of low concern to both health and the environment. Consequently, they are not further addressed in this report. Regulatory conclusions for these two substances will be provided in a future assessment publication that addresses a range of substances in this situation.<br>
    </p>
    <p >In Canada, substances in the Ethylene Glycol Ethers Group are used in a variety of applications, including cosmetics and non-prescription drugs, paint and coating products, and air fresheners, as well as in adhesives, batteries, and textiles.</p>
    <p >All of the substances in this group are imported into Canada in quantities ranging from 100&nbsp;to&nbsp;10 000&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg/year. Four&nbsp;of the seven&nbsp;substances&nbsp;(TTEG,&nbsp;DEGEE,&nbsp;EGBEA, and&nbsp;DEGBE) in this group are manufactured in Canada in quantities ranging from&nbsp;1&nbsp;000&nbsp;to&nbsp;10&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg/year. In the United States, production volumes range from&nbsp;10&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 to&nbsp;450&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg/year&nbsp;for these substances.</p>
    <p >The ecological risks of the seven substances in the Ethylene Glycol&nbsp;Ethers&nbsp;Group were characterized using the Ecological Risk Classification of organic substances (ERC). The ERC is a risk-based approach that employs multiple metrics for both hazard and exposure based on weighted consideration of multiple lines of evidence for determining risk classification. Hazard profiles are established based principally on metrics regarding mode of toxic action, chemical reactivity, food web&ndash;derived internal toxicity thresholds, bioavailability, and chemical and biological activity. Metrics considered in the exposure profiles include potential emission rate, overall persistence, and long-range transport potential. A risk matrix is used to assign a low, moderate or high level of potential concern for substances based on their hazard and exposure profiles. The&nbsp;ERC identified the seven substances in the Ethylene&nbsp;Glycol&nbsp;Ethers&nbsp;Group as having low potential to cause ecological harm.</p>
    <p >Considering all available lines of evidence presented in this draft screening assessment, there is a low risk of harm to organisms and the broader integrity of the environment from the seven substances in the Ethylene Glycol Ethers Group. It is proposed to conclude that the seven substances in the Ethylene Glycol Ethers Group do not meet the criteria under paragraph&nbsp;64(<cite>a</cite>)&nbsp;or&nbsp;(<cite>b</cite>) of CEPA, as they are not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity or that constitute or may constitute a danger to the environment on which life depends.</p>
    <p >For the human health risk assessment, the seven substances in this group were separated into&nbsp;three&nbsp;subgroups: ethylene glycols&nbsp;(EGs), ethylene glycol ethers&nbsp;(EGEs), and glymes. Environmental media and food were not identified as significant sources of exposure to Canadians. For the EGs and EGEs, estimates of exposure were derived based on levels of substances in products used by consumers, such as cosmetics and non-prescription drugs, paint and coating products, and household cleaning products. For monoglyme, estimates of exposure were based on levels in indoor air and from use of air fresheners.</p>
    <p >Systemic toxicity is observed at high dose levels in laboratory animals exposed to ethylene glycol ethers, with target organs being the liver and kidneys. For some of the substances (DEGEE, EGBEA, and DEGBE), hemolytic effects observed in laboratory animals at the doses tested are not of concern for humans, as humans are much less sensitive to these effects. For monoglyme, developmental toxicity is observed in laboratory animals at doses lower than those for the other ethylene glycol ether substances in this group, along with effects on testes, blood, thymus and adrenal glands. For all subgroups, based on the estimates of exposure for products used by consumers and critical effect levels identified from laboratory studies, margins of exposure are considered to be adequate to address uncertainties in the health effects and exposure databases.</p>
    <p >Based on the information presented in this draft screening assessment, it is proposed to conclude that the seven substances in the Ethylene&nbsp;Glycol&nbsp;Ethers&nbsp;Group do not meet the criteria under paragraph&nbsp;64(<cite>c</cite>) of CEPA, as they are not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.</p>
    <h5>Proposed conclusion</h5>
    <p >It is proposed to conclude that the seven substances in the Ethylene&nbsp;Glycol&nbsp;Ethers&nbsp;Group do not meet any of the criteria set out in section&nbsp;64&nbsp;of&nbsp;CEPA. </p>
    <h5>Consideration for follow-up</h5>
    <p >While exposure of the general population to monoglyme is not of concern at current levels, this substance has a potential health effect of concern based on developmental toxicity. Therefore, there may be a concern for human health if exposures were to increase. Follow-up activities to track changes in exposure&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;commercial use patterns are under consideration.</p>
    <p >Stakeholders are encouraged to provide, during the 60-day public&nbsp;comment&nbsp;period on the draft screening assessment, any information pertaining to the substance that may help inform the choice of follow-up&nbsp;activity. This could include information on new or planned import, manufacture or use of the substance, or information not previously submitted to the ministers.</p>
    <p >The draft screening assessment for these substances is available on the Government of Canada's Chemical Substances website (www.chemicalsubstances.gc.ca).</p>

    <h3>ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACT</h3>
    <h4><cite>Notice of intent to improve the energy efficiency of appliances and equipment through Amendment 15 to the</cite> Energy Efficiency Regulations</h4>
    <p >Notice is hereby given that the Department of Natural Resources is initiating the development of Amendment&nbsp;15 to the <cite>Energy Efficiency Regulations</cite> under the <cite>Energy Efficiency Act</cite> to increase the stringency of existing energy efficiency standards for 11&nbsp;product categories and to introduce such standards for the first time in Canada for 6&nbsp;product categories.</p>
    <h4><cite>Background</cite></h4>
    <p >The Government of Canada is committed to taking action&nbsp;on climate change by improving energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment, and reducing regulatory burden through alignment with the United States and collaboration with provinces and territories. Improving energy efficiency standards provides both economic and environmental benefits to Canada.</p>
    <p >The <cite>Energy Efficiency Regulations</cite> were introduced in&nbsp;1995 as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. They prescribe energy efficiency standards for energy-using products used in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. They also prescribe labelling requirements for certain products to disclose and compare the energy use of a given product model relative to others in their category. The Regulations have been amended regularly to update existing energy efficiency standards and introduce standards for new products.</p>
    <p >In March&nbsp;2016, Canada and the United States committed to better align and further improve energy efficiency standards by&nbsp;2020. Moreover, Canada committed to align up to 10&nbsp;test methods and standards with the United States and Mexico by&nbsp;2019. This builds on the 2014&nbsp;Canada&ndash;United States Regulatory Cooperation Council commitment to align new and updated energy efficiency standards and test methods for energy-using equipment, to the extent practicable and permitted by law. Alignment of requirements can avoid creating unnecessary duplication and costs, reduce trade barriers and enhance consumer choice.</p>
    <p >Through the pan-Canadian framework and Energy and Mines Ministers' Conference, the federal, provincial and territorial governments have committed to working together to achieve climate change goals. Through this collaboration, governments agreed that the stringency of standards for some heating products could, for climatic and market reasons, exceed the stringency of those in the United States.</p>
    <h4><cite>Amendments to the Regulations</cite></h4>
    <p >Natural Resources Canada is proceeding with the development of Amendment&nbsp;15 to introduce or update energy efficiency standards and, where applicable, test methods and associated reporting and compliance requirements for the 17&nbsp;product categories listed below. The intent is to align&nbsp;11 of the 17&nbsp;product categories with energy efficiency standards in force or expected to be in force in the United States, subject to an analysis of Canadian market conditions. For the remaining 6 product categories, NRCan will undertake an analysis of the environmental and economic impacts of moving to more stringent standards.</p>
    <p >Products for which NRCan will consider more stringent standards than those of the United States are indicated with an &ldquo;*&rdquo; in the table below.</p>

    <h3>CONSULTATIONS ON A POTENTIAL FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA</h3>
    <p >On September&nbsp;22, 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that Canada and China had launched exploratory discussions for a possible Canada&ndash;China Free Trade Agreement (see press release). <a href="#footnote.56200" id="footnoteRef.56200">(see footnote 18)</a></p>
    <p >Parallel to the exploratory discussions, the Government of Canada is seeking the views of Canadians on how to best proceed regarding a possible Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This would include how to best improve market access and legal certainty and transparency for Canadian business, but also to understand any other related issues and concerns that are relevant when considering a possible FTA.</p>
    <p >The Government is soliciting views from businesses, civil society organizations, labour unions, academia, individual Canadians, Indigenous groups, and provincial and territorial governments on objectives, key interests and potential concerns, which will help outline the parameters of a potential initiative.</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p >China is Canada's second-largest single-country trading partner and a key market for Canada in the Asia-Pacific region. In&nbsp;2016, two-way merchandise trade amounted to $85.3&nbsp;billion. Canada's two-way foreign direct investment (FDI) relationship with China is also significant and reached $33.0&nbsp;billion at the end of&nbsp;2015. China is Canada's largest source of international students and third largest source of tourists.</p>
    <p >With a population of almost 1.4&nbsp;billion, a GDP of C$14.8&nbsp;trillion in&nbsp;2016, and a forecasted average annual economic growth rate of around 5.4% over the next 15&nbsp;years, China and the Chinese market present opportunities for Canadian companies in a wide variety of sectors. China's ongoing transition to a more service-oriented, consumer-based economy and its growing middle class have created demand for quality agricultural and agri-food products, advanced manufacturing, reliable sources of energy, financial and professional services, and innovative technologies and service solutions.</p>
    <p >A potential free trade agreement with China could result in economic gains for Canada by creating opportunities for Canadian firms, including small and medium-sized enterprises, that are looking to grow their business in international markets and by improving market access conditions for Canadian businesses operating in China. Canadian consumers may also benefit from a potential free trade agreement with China as a result of enhanced access to safe and affordable goods from China.</p>
    <p >Canadians may have concerns about China, including issues relating to the environment, labour, gender equality, rule of law and human rights. Canada's comprehensive dialogue with China is central to a healthy relationship and allows Canada to relay the concerns of Canadians and to engage with a country that hosts one sixth of the world's population. A free trade agreement with China would not deter Canada from urging and working with China to meet its international obligations in these areas. As Canada pursues future&nbsp;trade agreements, it will ensure policy flexibility is reserved to protect the health, safety and environment of Canadians.</p>

    <h4><cite>Notice No. SMSE-009-17</cite> &mdash; Consultation on the Licensing Framework for Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit (NGSO) Systems and Clarification of Application Procedures for All Satellite Licence Applications</h4>
    <p >The intent of this notice is to initiate, through the release of the above-mentioned document, a public consultation on modifications to various elements of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada's (ISED) licensing framework as it applies to non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) systems. In particular, ISED is seeking views on whether to impose a limit on the number of licences issued per frequency band for certain commercial systems; changes to Canadian direction and control, coverage and capacity requirements; the removal of coexistence as an assessment criteria; and possible measures to be used in the event of domestic frequency coordination disputes. Views are also sought on a clarification to the first come, first served licensing rules as they apply to all satellite applications.</p>
    <p >Following the comment period, ISED will issue updates to Radio Systems Policy RP-008 &mdash;<cite> Policy Framework for Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS) and Broadcasting-Satellite Service (BSS)</cite> and Client Procedures Circular CPC-2-6-02 &nbsp;&mdash;<cite> Licensing of Space Stations</cite> on ISED's Spectrum Management and Telecommunications website at www.ic.gc.ca/spectrum. Two weeks following the publication of these updates, the moratorium on licence applications for commercial NGSO systems will be lifted. A Spectrum Advisory Bulletin will be published on the Department's website to provide advance notice, but there will be no accompanying notice in the <cite>Canada Gazette</cite>.</p>
    <h4>Submitting comments</h4>
    <p >Interested parties should submit their comments no later than April&nbsp;3, 2017. Soon after the close of the comment period, all comments will be posted on ISED's Spectrum Management and Telecommunications website at www.ic.gc.ca/spectrum.</p>
    <p >The Department will also provide interested parties with the opportunity to reply to comments from other parties. Reply comments will be accepted for 15 days following the posting of comments. All comments and reply comments will be reviewed and considered by the Department in arriving at a final position on the issues raised in the consultation.</p>
    <p >Respondents are requested to provide their comments in electronic format (Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF), along with a note specifying the software, version number and operating system used, to the following email address: ic.satelliteauthorization-autorisationsatellite.ic@canada.ca.
